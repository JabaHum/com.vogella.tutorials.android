		<title>Registering broadcast receiver for custom events
		
			You can register a
			receiver
			for your custom actions.
		
		
			The following
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file demonstrates a broadcast receiver which is registered for a
			custom action.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/own/AndroidManifest.xml" />

		<title>Sending broadcast intents
		
			The
			`sendBroadcast()`
			method from the
			`Context`
			class allows you to send
			intents
			to your registered receivers. The following coding show an example.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/own/trigger.java" />
			</programlisting>
		


		
			You cannot trigger system broadcasts events.
			The Android system
			will
			prevent
			this.
		
		<tip>
			
				The receivers are called asynchronous, i.e.,
				the
				`sendBroadcast()`
				method return immediately and does not wait
				until the receivers have
				executed.
			
		</tip>

		<title>Local broadcast events with LocalBroadcastManager

		
			The
			`LocalBroadcastManager`
			class is used to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local
			objects within your process. This is faster and more secure as your
			events don't leave your application.
		
		
			The following example shows an activity
			which registers for a customer event called
			_my-event_
			.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/localbroadcastreceiver/Register.java" />
