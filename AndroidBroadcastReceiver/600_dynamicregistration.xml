		<title>Dynamically registered receiver
		
			Receiver can be registered via the Android manifest file.
			You can also
			register and unregister
			a receiver at runtime
			via the
			`Context.registerReceiver()`
			and
			`Context.unregisterReceiver()`
			methods.
		

		<warning>
			
				Do not forget to unregister a dynamically registered
				_receiver_
				by using
				`Context.unregisterReceiver()`
				method.
				If you forget this, the Android system reports a
				`leaked broadcast receiver`
				error.
				For instance, if you registered a receive in
				`onResume()`
				methods of
				your activity, you should unregister it in the
				`onPause()`
				method.

			file.

		<title>Sticky (broadcast) intents
		
			An intent to trigger a receiver (
			_broadcast intent_
			)
			is not available anymore after it was sent
			and processed by the
			system.
			If you use the
			`sendStickyBroadcast(Intent)`
			method, the corresponding
			_intent_
			is sticky, meaning the intent
			you are sending stays around after the
			broadcast is complete.
		

		
			The Android system uses sticky broadcast for certain system
			information. For example, the battery status is send as sticky
			intent
			and
			can get received at any time. The following example demonstrates
			that.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/sticky/check.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			You can
			retrieve that data
			through the return value of
			`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver,
				IntentFilter)
			`
			. This also works for a null
			`BroadcastReceiver`
			.
		
		
			In all other ways,
			this behaves just as
			`sendBroadcast(Intent)`
			.
		

		
			Sticky broadcast intents
			typically require special permissions.
