	<title>Automatically starting Services from a Receivers
	
		A common requirement is to automatically start a service after a
		system reboot, i.e., for synchronizing
		data. For this you can register
		a receiver
		for the
		`android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED`
		system event. This requires the
		`android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
		permission.
	

	
		The following example demonstrates the registration for the
		`BOOT_COMPLETED`
		event in the Android manifest file.
	

	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/autostart/AndroidManifest.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	


	
		The receive would start the service as demonstrated in the
		following example code.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/autostart/start.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	TIP:
		
			If your application is installed on the SD card, then it is not
			available after the
			`android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED`
			event. In this case register it for the
			`android.intent.action.ACTION_EXTERNAL_APPLICATIONS_AVAILABLE
			`
			event.
		
	</tip>
	<note>
		
			Remember that as of Android API level 11 the user needs to have
			started
			the
			application at least once before your application can
			receive
			`android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED`
			events.
