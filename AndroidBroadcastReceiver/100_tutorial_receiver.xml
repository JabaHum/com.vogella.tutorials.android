	<title>Exercise: Register a receiver for incoming phone calls
	<section id="tutorial_receiver1">
		<title>Target
		
			In this exercise you define a broadcast receiver which listens
			to telephone
			state
			changes. If the phone receives a phone call, then
			our
			receiver
			will be
			notified and log a message.
		
	
	<section id="tutorial_receiver2">
		<title>Create project
		
			Create a new project called
			`de.vogella.android.receiver.phone`
			. Also create an activity.
		
		<tip>
			
				Remember that your receiver is only called if the user started
				it once. This requires an activity.
			
		</tip>

	
	<section id="tutorial_receiver3">
		<title>Implement receiver for the phone event
		
			Create the
			`MyPhoneReceiver`
			class.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/receiver/MyPhoneReceiver.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="tutorial_receiver4">
		<title>Request permission
		
			Add the
			`android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`
			permission to your manifest file which allows you to listen to state
			changes in your receiver. Also Register your receiver in your
			manifest
			file. The resulting manifest should be similar to the
			following listing.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/receiver/AndroidManifest.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="tutorial_receiver5">
		<title>Validate implementations
		
			Install your application and simulate a phone call via the
			Android Device Monitor. Validate that your receiver is
			called and logs
			a message
			to
			the
			`LogCat`
			view.
