		<title>Definition
		
			A
			_broadcast receiver_
			(short
			_receiver_
			)
			is an Android component which allows you to register for system or
			application events. All registered receivers
			for an
			event are notified
			by the Android runtime once this event
			happens.
		
		
			For example, applications can register for the
			`ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED`
			system event
			which is fired once the Android system has
			completed
			the
			boot process.
		
	
	<section id="broadcastreceiver_implementation">
		<title>Implementation
		
			A
			receiver
			can be registered via the
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file.
		
		
			Alternatively to this static registration, you can also register
			a
			receiver
			dynamically via the
			`Context.registerReceiver()`
			method.
		
		
			The implementing class for a receiver
			extends the
			`BroadcastReceiver`
			class.
		
		
			If the event for which the
			broadcast receiver
			has registered happens,
			the
			`onReceive()`
			method of the receiver
			is called by the Android system.

		<title>Life cycle of a broadcast receiver
		
			After the
			`onReceive()`
			of the receiver class
			has finished,
			the Android system is allowed to
			recycle the receiver.
		

	
	<section id="broadcastreceiver_asynchronousprocessing">
		<title>Asynchronous processing
		
			Before API level 11, you could not
			perform any asynchronous operation
			in the
			`onReceive()`
			method, because once the
			`onReceive()`
			method had been finished,
			the Android system was allowed to recycle that
			component. If you have potentially long
			running operations, you should
			trigger a service instead.
		
		
			Since Android API 11 you can call the
			`goAsync()`
			method. This method returns an object of the
			`PendingResult`
			type.
			The Android system considers the
			receiver as alive
			until you call
			the
			`PendingResult.finish()`
			on this object. With this option you can trigger asynchronous
			processing in a receiver. As soon as that thread has
			completed, its
			task calls
			`finish()`
			to indicate to the Android system that this component can be
			recycled.
		
	

	<section id="broadcastreceiver_platformfilter">
		<title>Restrictions for defining broadcast receiver
		
			As of Android 3.1 the Android system excludes all
			receiver
			from receiving intents by default
			if the corresponding
			application has
			never been started by the user
			or if the user explicitly stopped the
			application via the Android
			menu
			(in
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Manage</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Application</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			).
		
		
			This is an additional security feature as the user can be sure that
			only the applications he started will receive
			broadcast
			_intents_
			.
		
		<tip>
			
				This does not mean the user has to start the application again
				after a reboot. The Android system remembers that
				the user already
				started it. Only one start is required without a forced stop by
				the user.
			
		</tip>

		<title>Send the broadcast to your application for testing
		You can use the following command from the adb command line tool. The class name and
			package names which are
			targeted via the command line tool need to be as defined in the manifest. You should send the intent
			you generated to
			your specific component, for example if you send a general ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, this
			will trigger a lot of
			things in an Android system.
