		<title>Notification Manager
		
			Android allows to put notification into the titlebar of your
			application.
			The user can expand the notification bar and by selecting
			the
			notification the user can trigger
			another activity.
		
		
			Because notifications can be very annoying, the user can disable
			notifications for each application. This can be done via the Settings
			application of the Android
			device. Select
			<guilabel>Apps</guilabel>
			in the Settings, select the app you are interested in
			and unset the
			<guilabel>Show notifications</guilabel>
			checkbox to prevent the app to show notifications.

		<title>Setting up Notifications
		
			Notifications in Android are represented by the
			`Notification`
			class.
			To create notifications you use the
			`NotificationManager`
			class which can be received from the
			`Context`
			, e.g. an
			_activity_
			or a
			_service_
			,
			via the
			`getSystemService()`
			method.

			The
			`Notification.Builder`
			provides an builder interface to create an
			`Notification`
			object. You use a
			`PendingIntent`
			to specify the action which should be performed once the user select
			the notification.
		

		
			The
			`Notification.Builder`
			allows you to add up to three buttons with definable actions to the
			notification.

			Android 4.1 supports expandable notifications. In addition to
			normal
			notification view it is possible to define a big view
			which gets
			shown
			when notification is expanded. There are three
			styles to be used
			with
			the big view: big picture style, big text
			style, Inbox style. The
			following code demonstrates the usage of the
			`BigTextStyle()`
			which allows to use up to 256
			dp.

		<title>Canceling Notifications
		The user can dismiss all notification or if you set your
			notification to auto-cancel it is also removed once the user selects
			it.
		
		
			You can also call the
			`cancel()`
			for a specific notification ID on the
			`NotificationManager`
			. The
			`cancelAll()`
			method call removes all
			of the notifications you
			previously issued.
