		<title>Activating GPS on the emulator
		
			You need to activate GPS on your test device. If you test on the
			emulator and its not activated you
			"null" if you try to use a
			`LocationManager`
			.
		
		
			The Google Map
			_activity_
			should automatically activate the GPS device in the emulator but if
			you
			want to use the location manager directly you need to do this
			yourself.
			Currently their seems to be an issue with this.
		
		
			Start Google Maps on the emulator and request the current
			geo-position, this
			will allow you to activate the
			GPS. Send new GPS
			coordinates to the Android emulator.
