			Google provides via Google play a
			library for using Google Maps
			in your application. The following description is based on the Google
			Maps Android API v2 which provides significant improvements to the
			older API version.

		
		
			The library provides the
			`com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment`
			class and the
			`MapView`
			class for displaying the map component.
		
		
			You need to add additional
			information to your
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file to use Google Maps.

		<title>MapFragment
		
			The
			`MapFragment`
			class
			extends the
			`Fragment`
			class and provides the
			life cycle management and the services for
			displaying a
			`GoogleMap`
			widget.
			`GoogleMap`
			is the class which shows the map. The
			`MapFragment`
			has the
			`getMap()`
			method to access this class.
		
		
			the
			`LatLng`
			class can be used to interact with the
			`GoogleView`
			class.

		<title>Markers
		
			You can create markers on the map via the
			`Marker`
			class. This class can be highly customized.
		
		The following code shows an example.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/markers/Marker.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			On the
			`GoogleMap`
			you can register a listener for the
			markers in your map via the
			`setOnMarkerClickListener(OnMarkerClickListener)`
			method. The
			`OnMarkerClickListener`
			class defines the
			`onMarkerClicked(Marker)`
			method which is called if a marker is clicked.
		
		Similar to you also listen to drag events and info window
			clicks.
