		<title>Google console
		
			To use Google Maps you need to create a valid Google Maps API
			key. The key is free, you can use it with any of your applications
			that call the Maps API, and it supports an unlimited number of
			users.
		
		
			You get this key via the
			https://code.google.com/apis/console/[ Google APIs Console]
			. . You have
			to provide your application signature key and the
			application package
			name.
		
		
			This is based
			on the
			key with which you sign your Android
			application
			during
			deployment. During development with Eclipse, Eclipse us
			automatically
			creates
			and uses a
			_debug key_
			.
		
	
	<section id="maps_key2">
		<title>Creating the SHA-1 for your signature key
		
			The Eclipse debug
			key for signing your application can be found in the
			<filename>userhome/.android/debug.keystore</filename>
			file.
		
		
			To create the SHA-1 for your debug keystore you use the
			`keytool`
			command from your JDK
			installation pointing to the
			<filename>debug.keystore</filename>
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/maps/key.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		Copy the SHA-1 output, as you need this later.
	
	<section id="maps_key3">
		<title>Register with the Google APIs Console
		
			You have to register in
			the
			_Google APIs Console_
			that you want to use Google Maps for Android. You can reach this
			console via the following link:
			https://code.google.com/apis/console/[ Google APIs Console]
			. Select here the
			<guilabel>Services</guilabel>
			entry.

				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Google APIs Console</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			Activate the
			<guilabel>Google Maps Android API v2</guilabel>
			.

	<section id="maps_key4">
		<title>Create key for your application
		
			You need later to register your application via its package in
			this
			console together with the SHA-1 fingerprint of your signature
			key. For
			this you select the entry and click on the
			<guilabel>API Access</guilabel>
			entry. Afterwards click on the
			<guibutton>Create new Android key...</guibutton>
			entry.
		
		
			<mediaobject>

					<imagedata fileref="images/apiconsole30.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Google APIs Console</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			Enter your SHA-1 fingerprint and the package of your application
			separated by a semicolon. For example you can use the
			`com.vogella.android.locationapi.maps`
			package.
