    <title>Create log statements

        To write log statements, you use the
        `android.util.Log`
        class with the
        `Log.v()`
        ,
        `Log.d()`
        ,
        `Log.i()`
        ,
        `Log.w()`
        ,
        `Log.e()`
        or
        `Log.wtf()`
        method. They are sorted by relevance with
        `Log.i()`
        being the least important one.
        The first
        parameter of these methods is the category
        and
        the second
        is the
        message.
    

    
        Typically you create a
        `Constants`
        interface in your Android application and provide your log flag as a
        field.
    
    
        <programlisting language="java">
            <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
                parse="text" href="./examples/log/Constants.java" />
        </programlisting>
    
    
        Android advises that a deployed application should not contain
        logging
        code. The Android development tools provide the
        `BuildConfig.DEBUG`
        <indexterm>
            <primary>BuildConfig</primary>
        </indexterm>
        flag for this purpose. This flag will be automatically set to
        `false`
        if you export the Android application for deployment. During
        development it will be set to
        `true`
        , therefore allowing you to see your
        logging statements during
        development.
    
    
        The following example show how to write an error log message.
    

    
        <programlisting language="java">
            <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
                parse="text" href="./examples/log/log.java" />
        </programlisting>
