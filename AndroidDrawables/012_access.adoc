== Using drawables for views
	
Drawables
are referred to
in XML
via
`@drawable/filename`
whereby
`filename`
filename is the filename without the file extension. For example to
access the
_res/drawable/hello.png_
Drawable, you would use
`@drawable/hello`
as demonstrated in the following snippet.

include::res/bitmap/activity_main.xml[]

In code you can also assign
_drawables_
to views. Most
views
accept an resource ID as input parameter. For
example the following
code shows how to set a
_drawables_
as background to an
`ImageView`.
