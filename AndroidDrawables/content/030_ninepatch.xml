	<title>9 Patch Drawables
	
		_9 Patch drawables_
		are
		_Drawables_
		which have a one pixel additional border. On the top and
		left you
		define the area which should be scaled if the
		_Drawable_
		is to small for the
		view. This is the stretch area.

		On the right and bottom side you define the area where a text should
		be
		placed
		if this
		`Drawable`
		is used on a
		view
		which can write text on it, e.g. a Button.
	
	
		The ADT supplies the
		<parameter>draw9patch</parameter>
		program in the
		<filename>android-sdk/tools</filename>
		installation folder, which makes it easy to
		create
		_9 Patch drawables_
		.
