	<title>Using drawables for views
	
		Drawables
		are referred to
		in XML
		via
		`@drawable/filename`
		whereby
		`filename`
		filename is the filename without the file extension. For example to
		access the
		_res/drawable/hello.png_
		Drawable, you would use
		`@drawable/hello`
		as demonstrated in the following snippet.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/bitmap/activity_main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	


	
		In code you can also assign
		_drawables_
		to views. Most
		views
		accept an resource ID as input parameter. For
		example the following
		code shows how to set a
		_drawables_
		as background to an
		`ImageView`
		.
