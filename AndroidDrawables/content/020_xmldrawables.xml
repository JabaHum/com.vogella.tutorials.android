		<title>Shape Drawables
		
			Shape Drawables are XML files which allow to define a geometric
			object with colors, borders and gradients which can get assigned to
			`Views`
			. The advantage of using XML Shape Drawables is that they
			automatically adjust to the correct size.
		
		The following listing shows an example of a Shape Drawable.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/drawable/myshape.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		You could for example assign that drawable to the background
			property of your
			layout.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/drawable/main.xml" />
			</programlisting>

		<title>State Drawables
		
			State drawables allow to define states. For each state a
			different
			drawable can get assigned to the
			`View`
			. For example the
			following
			defines different drawables for a button
			depending on its
			state.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/drawable/state.xml" />

		<title>Transition Drawables

			triggered in the coding.
