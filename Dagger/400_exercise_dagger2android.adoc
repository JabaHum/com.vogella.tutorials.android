[[exercise_androiddagger]]
== Exercise: Dependency injection in Android with Dagger 2

[[exercise_androiddagger_target]]
=== Target of this exercise

In this exercise Dagger 2 is demonstrated in an Android application.
In our simple app, there is an activity that allows a user to authenticate some credentials. 
The result value of the implementation is displayed in a text field.

[[exercise_androiddagger_project]]
=== Create project

Create a new project with the top level package `com.vogella.android.dagger2simple`.

Adjust the layout file of the generated activity. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/activity_main.xml[]
----
	
[[exercise_androiddagger_gradle]]
=== Enter Gradle dependencies

Add the following entries to your _build.gradle_ project file.

[source,java]
----
include::res//android/build.gradle[]
----
	
Add the following entries to your _app/build.gradle_ file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/appbuild.gradle[]
----

[[exercise_androiddagger_di]]
=== Define your dependencies graph

Create the following classes for providing dependencies and wiring them up.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/NetworkApi.java[]
----

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/NetworkApiModule.java[]
----

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/DiComponent.java[]
----

[[exercise_androiddagger_using]]
=== Wiring up the application

Create the following implementation for your `Application` class. 
This class builds up the dependency injection context and gives access to it, via the `getComponent` method.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/MyApplication.java[]
----

Of course this class needs to registered via the manifest. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----

The activity injects the created values into it via the method defined on the @Component class.  

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/MainActivity.java[]
----

[[exercise_androiddagger_validate]]
=== Validate

Run your application, the user interface should report that dependency injection worked. 
If not, have a look at the generated classes in the _app/build/generated/apt_ folder. 
The generated classes by Dagger are well structured and should give a hint what went wrong.
