== Dagger 2 and field injection

=== Special treatment of fields in Dagger
		
Dagger 2 does not inject fields automatically. 
It can also not inject private fields. 
If you want to use field injection you have to define a method in your `@Component` interface which takes the instance into which you want to inject as parameter.

[[dagger2_fieldinjection_example]]
=== Example

Assume you modify your BackendServer class to the following. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/fields/BackendService.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/fields/BackEndServiceModule.java[]
----		
		
In this case you have to define a method which allows injecting into `BackendServer` and use it in your final wiring.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fields/MyComponent.java[]
----		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/fields/Main.java[]
----
