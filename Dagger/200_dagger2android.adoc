== Dagger 2 and Android

[[android_dagger_problem]]
=== Using dependency injection with Android
		
Many Android components, e.g. activities, are instantiated by the Android framework and not in your code.
This makes it difficult to supply dependencies via constructors to Android components.

== Using Dagger 2 in Android

To enable Dagger 2 adjust your _build.gradle_ project file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/build.gradle[]
----
		
Add the following entries to your _app/build.gradle_ file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/appbuild.gradle[]
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to configure apt for each scope in which Dagger should be used.
For example `apt` for you normal app, `testApt` for your JVM tests and `testAndroidApt` for your Android tests.
