	<title>Programming tips for providing highly responsive and fast Android applications
	Android devices have less power than standard desktop or
		notebook
		computers. For this reason you must be careful
		with memory
		consumption.
	
	Especially on Android devices before Android 5.0 you want to
		avoid triggering the garbage collector of the
		virtual machine as this
		results in a freeze of the Android runtime for about 200 ms and that
		can be a notable delay if
		the user is for example scrolling down a
		list.
