	<title>Avoid unnecessary object allocation
	
		Avoid creating unnecessary objects, especially in expensive places. Reuse objects if possible. Creating
		unnecessary objects triggers the garbage
		collection more frequently, and this should be avoided.
	
	
		For example avoid object creating in
		loops or in
		the
		`onDraw()`
		method of your custom view.
