	<title>Avoid unnecessary object allocation</title>
	<para>
		Avoid creating unnecessary objects, especially in expensive places. Reuse objects if possible. Creating
		unnecessary objects triggers the garbage
		collection more frequently, and this should be avoided.
	</para>
	<para>
		For example avoid object creating in
		loops or in
		the
		<code>onDraw()</code>
		method of your custom view.
