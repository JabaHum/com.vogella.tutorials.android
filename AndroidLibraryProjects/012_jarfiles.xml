		<para>
			If you want to use libraries, these must only use API
			available in
			Android. For example, the Android libraries do
			not
			contain the
			<code>java.awt</code>
			and
			<code>javax.swing</code>
			user interface libraries, as Android has its own user interface
			toolkit.
		</para>
		<para>
			Library
			projects cannot be
			compiled to Android applications and
			started without another project using them.
		</para>
		<para>
			Using library projects helps you to structure your application
			code. Also more and more important Open Source libraries are
			available for Android. Understanding library projects is therefore
			important for every Android programmer.
