		The Android team introduced a new binary distribution format
		called
		<wordasword>Android ARchive(AAR)</wordasword>
		. The
		<filename>.aar</filename>
		bundle is the binary distribution of an Android Library
		Project.
	</para>
	<para>
		An AAR
		is similar to a JAR file, but it can contain resources
		as
		well
		as
		compiled byte-code. This allows that an AAR
		file is
		included
		in the build
		process of an Android application similar to
		a
		<filename>JAR</filename>
		file
	</para>
	<warning>
		<para>
			This AAR format is currently directly support by the Eclipse
			IDE.
			Stare on the following issue so that Google solves this issue:
			<ulink url="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=59183">Allows Eclipse ADT plugin to work with .AAR files
			</ulink>
			.

	</warning>

	<tip>
		<para>
			It is still possible to use AAR files with Eclipse. You can either
			convert them to
			Android library
			projects as described in
			<ulink
				url="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/07/03/consuming-aars-eclipse.html">Consuming AARs from Eclipse</ulink>
			blog post about it.

		or use the

		plug-in for your build.
