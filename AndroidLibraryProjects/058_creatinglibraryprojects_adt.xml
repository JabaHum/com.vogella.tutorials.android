			To use such a library project in Eclipse, select the generated project,
			right-click
			on it
			and select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Properties</guimenu>
			</menuchoice>
			.
			On the
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Android</guimenu>
			</menuchoice>
			tab, add the library
			project to it.
		
		
			If you define components, e.g., activities in your library
			project,
			you need to re-define these components in the consuming
			Android
			application. If you want to automatically add all components
			from your
			library project to your application, add the
			<property>manifestmerger.enabled=true</property>
			to your
			<filename>project.properties</filename>
			file of your
			application project.
