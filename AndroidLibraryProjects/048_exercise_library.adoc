== Exercise: Create Android library module

=== Target
		
Our library project will not contribute Android components but a
data
model and a method to get the number of
instances. The library
provides access to (fake) RSS data. An
_RSS_
document is an XML file which can be used to publish blog
entries and
news. The format of the XML
file
is specified via
the RSS
specification.
		
Our library project will not contribute Android components but a
data model and a method to get the number of
instances. We will
provide RSS-feed data. You can find an introduction to RSS under:
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RSSFeed/article.html#rssoverview

=== Create library module
		
For Android Studio each library is a module. To create a new library
module in Android Studio, select
menu:File[New Module]
and select
`Android Library`.

Use
_com.example.android.rssfeedlibrary_
as module name and
_Rssfeed Library_
as library name.

If prompted for a template select that no activity should be created. 
As a result Android Studio shows another module.

=== Create the model class
		
Create an
`RssItem`
class which can store data of an RSS entry.
		
Generate the getters and setter, the constructor and a
`toString()`
method. The result should look like the following class:
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssItem.java[]
----		
	
=== Create instances
		
Create a new class called
`RssFeedProvider`
with a static method to return a list of
`RssItem`
objects. This method does currently only return
test data.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssFeedProvider.java[]
----		
	
=== Define dependency to the library project
		
		
To use the library add it as a dependency in your project select
menu:File[Project Structure]. 
Select the
_app_
entry. Switch to the
`Dependencies`
tab and select
`Module dependencies`
via the + sign.

=== Use library project to update detailed fragments
		
Use the static method of
`RssFeedProvider`
to get the list of
`RssItem`
objects and display the number in your
`DetailFragment`
instead of current system time.
		
To send the new data, change the
`updateDetail`
method in your
`MyListFragment`
class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/AccessLibrary.java[]
----		
	
=== Validate implementation
		
Start your application and ensure that the
`toString`
value of the (at the moment randomly generated) list of
RssItems is displayed in
the
detailed fragment.
