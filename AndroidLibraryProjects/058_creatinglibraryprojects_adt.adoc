== Creating custom Android library modules in Eclipse ADT

=== Defining Libraries modules in Eclipse ADT
		
To use such a library project in Eclipse, select the generated project,
right-click
on it
and select
menu:Properties[].
On the
menu:Android[]
tab, add the library
project to it.
		
If you define components, e.g., activities in your library
project,
you need to re-define these components in the consuming
Android
application. If you want to automatically add all components
from your
library project to your application, add the
`manifestmerger.enabled=true`
to your
_project.properties_
file of your
application project.
