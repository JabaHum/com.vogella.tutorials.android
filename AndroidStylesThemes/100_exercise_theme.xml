			the
			most.

		<title>Exercise: Define a modified custom theme
		<note>
			The Android tools team at Google likes to change the project templates. This means that the styles resource
				file
				might already be created or that the base theme which is extended is different.
			
		</note>
		
			Create or edit the existing
			_styles.xml_
			file for the Android version your are testing with. This requires defining the correct version qualifier for the
			folder which contains the file.
		
		
			Add a new color constant called
			`my_color`
			defining the
			`#b0b0ff`
			value to the file.
		
		

			Modify or add the
			`AppTheme`
			. It should override the
			`android:windowBackground`
			property with your color.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/styles/styles_simple.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Assign this theme to your application. Your application should use a
			different background color.
