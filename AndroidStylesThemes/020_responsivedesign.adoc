== Responsive design

=== Responsive design consideration

It is recommended that the application scales with the device.
On a small screen only one fragment is shown, on a larger screen a
second or even third fragment might be visible.

This approach is depicted by the following graphic.

=== Margin points

It is recommended not to use the screen width for text in case
you are beyond
 a certain width on a device, as this is not very friendly for
the readers eyes. This is typically
`w1000dp`
.

A way to implement margin points is to use a
_res/values/dimens.xml_
file and define a dimension for the margins. Afterwards use resource
qualifiers for the same file to define different margins for larger
devices.
