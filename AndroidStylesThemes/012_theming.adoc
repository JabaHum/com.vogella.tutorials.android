== Styles and Themes

=== Styles

Android allow you to define the look and feel, for example
colors and
fonts, of Android
components
in XML
resource files.

This
way
you
have to set
common style
attributes only once in one
central place.

If the entry in the resource file is used to style
a
view, it is
typically referred to as a
_style_
, while if it is used for styling an activity or application it is
typically called a
_theme_
/.

To define a style or a theme, save an XML file in the
_/res/values_
directory of
your project. The root node of the XML file must be <![CDATA[ <resources>]]>
and you use a
`style`
tag that includes the
`name`
attribute. This tag contains than more or more item tags which define
values for named attributes.

The following
_styles.xml_
XML file is an example for a style definition.

[source,java]
----
include::res/styles/styles.xml[]
----

You assign the style attribute to your elements, for example
to
the
text elements via
`style=‚Äù@style/text`
.

=== Inheritance

Styles (and themes) support inheritance by using the parent
attribute of the
style tag. This way the style inherits all settings
from the parent style and can overwrite selected attributes.

=== Referring attributes in the current theme

Android lists all standard attributes which can be styled in the
_R.attr_
file. The reference for this file can be found online under the
following URL:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html[R.attr]
.

You can refer to individual attributes of the current Android
theme
via the
`<![CDATA[?android:attr]]>`
notation.
This notation means that you are
referring
to a style
attribute in the currently active theme.

For example
`<![CDATA[?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeight]]>`
means: "use the value
defined by the attribute called
listPreferredItemHeight in the
current theme.

The following layout
defines buttons with
the Android 4.0
button
style.

=== Themes

A theme is a style applied to an entire
activity
or application,
rather than an individual View (as in the example
above). The
technique of defining a theme is the same as defining a style.

The next example show how to define your own theme while
extending a platform theme.
