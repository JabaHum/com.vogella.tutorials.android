		It is recommended that the application scales with the device.
			On a small screen only one fragment is shown, on a larger screen a
			second or even third fragment might be visible.
		
		This approach is depicted by the following graphic.

			It is recommended not to use the screen width for text in case
			you are beyond
			 a certain width on a device, as this is not very friendly for
			the readers eyes. This is typically
			`w1000dp`
			.
		
		
		
			A way to implement margin points is to use a
			_res/values/dimens.xml_
			file and define a dimension for the margins. Afterwards use resource
			qualifiers for the same file to define different margins for larger
			devices.
