== Android interface design

=== Designing Android Applications

The Android user interface design guidelines have changes over
the
years. The first big change for designing Android
applications
came
with the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) release which introduced the
_Holo_
style. The Android 5.0 (Lollipop) release was again a radical change
with the
_Material_
design. The material design introduces depth into the layout and uses
much more animations to provide feedback to the
user.

The
http://developer.android.com/design/index.html - Android
design pages give a detailed introduction into the design principles of Android
applications.

This page also contains several downloadable resources, e.g. an
icon
set for the
_ActionBar_
.

=== Download design material

The Android design page provides prepared resources and icons. You find the downloads on the
http://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html[Android design download]
webpage.


If you choose to download and use these icons, select a fitting for
a refresh action and place it into the
<filename class="directory">/res/drawable-mdpi_
folder. Make sure that the filename of your icon is
_ic_action_refresh_

WARNING: Icon filenames are not allowed to contain special
character,
cannot start with a number and must be in lower
case.

=== Creating promotional material

The
http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/device-art.html - Device Art Generator website 
allows you to create promotional material of your
application with a
nice device frame around it. Simply make a
screenshot on your device
and drag it onto the correct device to get
a nice image for it.

=== Material design

As of Android 5.0 (Lollipop, or API 21) the Android system support
_Material design_
.

Material design is a guide for visual, motion, and interaction
design. The
Android platform provides a new theme,
new widgets and
new
API for
custom shadows and animations.

One of the biggest design changes is that material design support
that views are drawn on top of other views by
assigning an elevation
level to them.
Views define an elevation
level in
dp
(density-independent pixels). To set the
elevation of a
view in a
layout definition, use the
android:elevation attribute. To
set the
elevation of a view in the
code of an activity, use the
`View.setElevation()`
method. Android draws customizable shadows based on the value of the
elevation.

Material design also provides improved API for animations and
defaults lots of user interface with animation
which should provide
feedback to the user.

=== Android design key principles

For designing great Android applications you should follow the
following themes.

* Design for touch
* Show only what is needed
* Don't ask for permission for a certain action but allow the user to undo his action
* Only interrupt, if it is important
* Keep messages brief, use pictures
* Never lose your users data
* Allow users to make important things fast
* If is looks the same, it should act the same
* Help users make decisions, but let them have the final say

=== Technical means for great Android application design

To design modern and fast reacting Android applications you should
use the following technologies.

* ActionBar
* Fragments
* Slide gesture for switching between tabs
* Expandable notifications
* Themes based on the Android platform themes
* Provide a home screen widget together with your application

== Design best practices

=== Design for performance

A well designed application should start fast. You should target
for less than one second in average to start the application.


All potentially slow operations should be performed
asynchronously.

=== Design for responsiveness

Feedback to the user should be provided instantaneous. Long
lasting operations should provide feedback to the user that they are
running.

=== Design for instant data

Your application should provide, if possible, recent data once the
user
starts it. You should therefore use
_services_
to fetch data from external servers to be decoupled from the user
interface.

=== Design for optimized battery life

Your application should consume as little energy as possible.
Stop user interface updates and listeners if your application is
currently not visible.

You can listen to relevant events, e.g. if
power supply is
plugged
in
to perform larger updates.

If you fetch data from an external server you should, if
appropriate, use the Google push notification service. This allows
you to access the network only if data is available.

=== Design for efficient network access

Your application should avoid unnecessary network access, via
push notifications. You should also consider the current available
network. If you are connected to a wireless lane, your application
can
download more data.
