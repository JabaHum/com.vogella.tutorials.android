	<title>Contributing to the action bar with fragments
	
		Fragments can also contribute entries to the
		toolbar bar.
	
	
		To do this,
		call
		`setHasOptionsMenu(true)`
		in the
		`onCreate()`
		method of the fragment. The Android framework calls in this case the
		`onCreateOptionsMenu()`
		method in the
		fragment
		class and adds its menu items to the ones
		added by
		the
		activity
		.
