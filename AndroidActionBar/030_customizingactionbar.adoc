== Customizing the toolbar
=== Changing the visibility of the toolbar bar

You can change the visibility of the toolbar at runtime. 
The following code demonstrates that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/modify/hide.java[]
----

You can also change the text which is displayed alongside the application icon at runtime. 
The following example shows that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/modify/title.java[]
----

=== Assigning a Drawable

You also add a `Drawable` to the action bar as background via the `ActionBar.setBackgroundDrawable()` method.

The toolbar scales the image. 
Therefore it is best practice to provide a scalable drawable , e.g., a 9-patch or XML drawable.

As of Android 4.2 the background of the action bar can also be animated via an `AnimationDrawable`.

=== Dimming the navigation buttons

You can also dim the software navigation button in your Android application to have more space available. 
If the user touches the button of the screen, the navigation button is automatically shown again.

Dimming the navigation buttons is demonstrated by the following code snippet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/navigation/hide.java[]
----

The following screenshots show an application with and without the navigation buttons.

=== Using immersive full screen mode

As of Android 4.4 (API 19) you can put your application into full screen mode. 
The first time this happens the system displays the user the info that he can restore the system bars with a downward swipe along the region where the system bars normally appear.

For example the following method also to put an activity into full screen mode.

[source,java]
----
include::res/navigation/immersivemode.java[]
----

=== Enabling the split toolbar

You can define that the toolbar should be automatically split by the system if not enough space is available.

You can activate this via the `android:uiOptions="SplitActionBarWhenNarrow"` parameter in the declaration of your application activity in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.

NOTE: If this option is activated, Android has the option to split the toolbar. 
Whether to split is decided by the system at runtime.
