			Fragments can also be used in combination with the action bar
			for
			navigation. For this your main activity
			needs to implement a
			`TabListener`
			,
			which is responsible for moving between the tabs.
		
		
			To add a new tab to the action bar, use the
			`newTab()`
			method.
		
		
			The following code shows such an activity. It uses dummy
			activities to demonstrate the switch.

			While the navigation drawer is relatively new compared to the
			other options, it is pretty popular among users and Android
			applications. If in doubt which options to select, consider using the
			navigation drawer.
