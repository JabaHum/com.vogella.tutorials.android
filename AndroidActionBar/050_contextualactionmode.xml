	<title>Making the toolbar context sensitive with the contextual action mode
	
		A contextual
		action mode activates
		a temporary toolbar
		that
		overlays
		the application toolbar
		for the duration of a particular
		sub-task.
	
	
		The contextual
		action mode is typically activated by selecting an
		item or by long clicking on it.
	
	
		To implement this, call the
		`startActionMode()`
		method on a view
		or on your
		activity. This method gets an
		`ActionMode.Callback`
		object which is responsible for the life cycle of the contextual
		action bar.
	

	
		You could also assign a context menu to a
		view
		via the
		`registerForContextMenu(view)`
		method. A
		context menu is also activated if the user "long
		presses"
		the
		view. The
		`onCreateContextMenu()`
		method is called every time a context menu is activated as
		the context
		menu is discarded after its usage.
		You should prefer the contextual
		action mode over the usage of
		context menus.
