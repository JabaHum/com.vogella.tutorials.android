		<title>Application icon as home
		
			The
			action bar
			shows an icon of your application. This is called the
			_home icon_
			. You
			can assign an
			action to
			this icon. The recommendation is to return
			to the main
			activity
			in your program if the user selects this icon.
		
		
			If the action is selected,
			the
			`onOptionsItemSelected()`
			method is called with an action which has the
			`android.R.id.home`
			ID.
		

		
			Before Android 4.1, you had to use the
			`android.R.id.home`
			ID in the
			`onOptionMenuItemSelected()`
			method and enable the selection of the home button. This is
			demonstrated by the following code in which
			the
			`SecondActivity`
			activity defines the
			`MainActivity`
			as home.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/navigation/home.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		<tip>
			
				As of Android 4.1 you can simply
				set the
				<property>parentActivityName</property>
				in the
				_AndroidManifest.xml_
				file pointing to the parent
				_activity_
				.
			
			
				<programlisting language="xml">
					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
						parse="text" href="./examples/navigation/home.xml" />
				</programlisting>

		<title>Application icon as Up button
		
			You can use the application icon also as 
			_Up_ button, e.g., to go
			to the parent activity of the current activity. The back button on
			the device always returns to the previous activity.
		
		
			Both can be different, for example, if the user started
			the option to write an email from the home screen,
			the back button will return
			the user to the home screen while the _Up_
			button would return the user
			to the activity which shows an overview of all emails.
		
		
			To enable the _Up_ display,
			you can use the following code snippet
			in your activity.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/homeupnavigation/Up.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		<note>
			
				This snippet only enables the _Up_ display
				on your home icon. You
				need
				to implement the correct behavior in your activity in the
				`onOptionsItemSelected()`
				method. The corresponding action still has the
				`android.R.id.home`
				ID.
			
		</note>

		<warning>
			
				The difference between _Up_ and the 
				_Back_ button
				can be confusing
				for the end user. If you decide to implement _Up_,
				in your application,
				it is recommended to perform some end user testing to see if the
				_Up_
				implementation is intuitive for them or not.
			
		</warning>
