		<title>Navigation pattern with the navigation drawer
		
			A popular navigation pattern in Android applications is the
			_navigation drawer_
			. The navigation drawer is a panel that displays the
			navigation
			options on the left side of the screen. It is hidden by default, but
			can be displayed with a swipe from the left side to the right or if
			the user touches the app icon. The usage of the navigation drawer is
			currently widespread within
			Android application.
		
		
			The usage of the navigation drawer in the Gmail application is
			depicted in the following
			screenshot.

			The navigation drawer is part of the support library v4. To use
			this
			navigation pattern, you create a layout with the
			`android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout`
			layout manager. This layout manager must contain only two child
			views. The
			first is the element for the main content and the second
			one the
			container for the drawer menu. The drawer menu is typically
			implemented with a
			`ListView`
			widget. Such a layout is demonstrated by the following snippet.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/drawer/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			You can fill the
			`ListView`
			in your activity code and register a listener via the
			`ListView.OnItemClickListern`
			method on
			the list item. In this listener you can perform the
			navigation
			action. For example, you start a new activity or replace a
			fragment in your layout.

		<title>Example: Using the navigation drawer
		
			The following example demonstrates the usage of the navigation
			drawer. If you want to follow this example, create a new Android
			project and ensure that the
			_support-v4_
			support library is added to it as dependency.
		
		
			Create a layout file
			called
			_fragment_layout_
			based on the following listing.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/drawer/fragment_layout.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Afterwards, create the
			`OpertingSystemFragment`
			class for the fragment.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/drawer/OpertingSystemFragment.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Now add a few strings and a string array to your
			_values/strings.xml_
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/drawer/strings.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		Finally create the activity as follows.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/drawer/MainActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			This above code assumes that you have an
			`R.drawable.ic_drawer`
			icon defined in your
			_drawables_
			folder.
		
		
			Run the application and test your navigation drawer.
