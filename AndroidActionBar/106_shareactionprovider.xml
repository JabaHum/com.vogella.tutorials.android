		<title>What is an action provider?
		
			An
			_action provider_
			defines rich menu interaction in a single
			component.
			It can generate
			action views,
			which are used in the
			action bar,
			dynamically populate
			sub-menus of
			an
			action and handle
			default action
			invocations.
		
		
			The base class for an action provider is the
			`ActionProvider`
			class.
		
		
			Currently the Android platform provides two
			action providers:
			the
			`MediaRouteActionProvider`
			and the
			`ShareActionProvider`
			.

		<title>Example: usage of the ShareActionProvider
		
			The following demonstrates the usage of the
			`ShareActionProvider`
			.
			This action provider
			allows you to grab selected content from
			applications which have
			registered the
			`Intent.ACTION_SEND`
			intent.
		
		
			To use
			`ShareActionProvider`,
			you
			have to define
			a
			special
			menu
			entry for it and assign an intent
			which
			contains the sharing data to it.
