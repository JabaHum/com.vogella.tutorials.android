== Using the navigation drawer

=== Navigation pattern with the navigation drawer
		
A popular navigation pattern in Android applications is the _navigation drawer_. 
The navigation drawer is a panel that displays the navigation options on the left side of the screen. 
It is hidden by default, but can be displayed with a swipe from the left side to the right or if the user touches the app icon. 
The usage of the navigation drawer is currently widespread within Android application.
		
The usage of the navigation drawer in the Gmail application is depicted in the following screenshot.

The navigation drawer is part of the support library v4. 
To use this navigation pattern, you create a layout with the `android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout` layout manager. 
This layout manager must contain only two child views. 
The first is the element for the main content and the second one the container for the drawer menu. 
The drawer menu is typically implemented with a `ListView` widget. 
Such a layout is demonstrated by the following snippet.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawer/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
You can fill the `ListView` in your activity code and register a listener via the `ListView.OnItemClickListern` method on the list item. 
In this listener you can perform the navigation action. 
For example, you start a new activity or replace a fragment in your layout.
		
=== Example: Using the navigation drawer
		
The following example demonstrates the usage of the navigation drawer. 
If you want to follow this example, create a new Android project and ensure that the _support-v4_ support library is added to it as dependency.
		
Create a layout file called _fragment_layout_ based on the following listing.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawer/fragment_layout.xml[]
----		
		
Afterwards, create the `OpertingSystemFragment` class for the fragment.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/drawer/OpertingSystemFragment.java[]
----
		
Now add a few strings and a string array to your _values/strings.xml_ file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/drawer/strings.xml[]
----		

Finally create the activity as follows.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/drawer/MainActivity.java[]
----		
		
This above code assumes that you have an `R.drawable.ic_drawer` icon defined in your _drawables_ folder.
		
Run the application and test your navigation drawer.
