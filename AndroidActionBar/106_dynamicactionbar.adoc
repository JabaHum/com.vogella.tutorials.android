== Making the action bar dynamic
=== Custom views in the action bar
		
You can also add a custom view to the action bar, for example, a button or a text field.
		
For this you use the `setCustomView` method of the `ActionView` class. 
You also have to enable the display of custom views via the `setDisplayOptions()` method by passing in the `ActionBar.DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM` flag.
		
For example, you can define a layout file which contains a `EditText` element.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/actionbar/actionbar_view.xml[]
----		

This layout can be assigned in an activity to the action bar via the following code. 
The example code also attaches a listener to the custom view.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/actionbar/custom.java[]
----

=== Action view
		
An _action view _ is a widget that appears in the _action bar_ as a substitute for an action item's button.
You can, for example, use this feature to replace an _action item_ with a `ProgressBar` view. 
An _action view_ for an action can be defined via the `android:actionLayout` or `android:actionViewClass` attribute to specify either a layout resource or widget class to use.
		
This replacement is depicted in the following screenshots.

The following activity replaces the icon at runtime with an _action view_ which contains a `ProgressBar` view.

The following code shows the layout used for the _action view_.
