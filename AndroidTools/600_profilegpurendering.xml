		In the
		<guilabel>Developer options</guilabel>
		in the
		<guilabel>Setting</guilabel>
		or your Android device you can activate
		_Profile GPU rendering_
		. With this option the system tracks the time it took to draw the last
		128 frames.
	

	After activating this and restarting your application you can get
		the information via the following command.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/gpu/trace.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	
	To measure the frame rate of your application, e.g. by scrolling
		on a list view. In most cases you need to interact with your
		application to trigger that it re-draws itself.
	
	
		In the resulting log, look for a section called
		_Profile data in ms_
		.
