		Continue to use the same example as in
		<xref linkend="exercise_tracewiew1" />
		. Open the
		<guilabel>Hierarchy View</guilabel>
		_perspective_
		and analyze the view layer.
	
	
		While none of these layout layers is very performance intensive
		it
		contains redundant layers and unnecessary views. Remove the
		unnecessary view layers.
