			_Traceview_
			is a graphical
			viewer to see logs created by an Android
			application.
			Via
			_Traceview_
			you can measure the performance of your application to
			identify
			performance problems.
		
		
			_Traceview_
			is located as standalone tool in the
			_tools_
			folder of your Android SDK installation folder and it also integrated
			into Eclipse via the Android Developer Tools
			(ADT).

		<title>Using Traceview from Android Studio
		
			Android Studio supports tracing via the Android Device Monitor. Use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Android</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>Android Device Monitor</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice> to open it.
		
		
			To start tracing an application select your application process in
			the
			<guilabel>Devices</guilabel>
			view
			and
			select the
			<guibutton>Start
				Method Profiling
			</guibutton>
			button as depicted in the following screenshot.

			Use your application and re-press the same button to stop
			profiling.
			This will open a new editor which shows you
			the tracing

		<title>Using TraceView from the command line
		
			To start tracing some code put the following
			code snippet around
			it.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/traceview/trace.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The parameter "yourstring" tells the system that it should
			store
			the
			data under "/sdcard/yourstring.trace". To save
			data on the
			sdcard
			your
			application needs the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
			After
			running
			your application you can
			copy the results from the device via
			the adb command line tool.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/traceview/gettraceview.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 This will start Traceview which allow you to analyze your
			performance data via a graphical way. The DDMS view
			has also a trace
			button available. This will
			trace the running application and does not
			require an additional
			authorization.
