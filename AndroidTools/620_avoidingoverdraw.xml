	<title>Analyzing Overdraw</title>
	<para>
		<wordasword>Overdraw</wordasword>
		happens if you draw something on top of something else. For
		example an
		<wordasword>activity</wordasword>
		has a
		<code>Window</code>
		as background. If a
		<code>TextView</code>
		it added to the application, the
		<code>TextView</code>
		is drawn on top of the
		<code>Window</code>
		.
	</para>
	<para>Overdrawn is therefore intended to happen. But unnecessary
		overdraw should be avoid to have the best performance possible.
	</para>
	<para>Unnecessary
		overdraw can be caused by complex view hierarchies. In
		general a 2x overdraw (a pixel gets drawn three times) is standard and
		expected but
		more should be
		avoided.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can enable a visualization of overdraw via the
		<guilabel>Development
			Settings
		</guilabel>
		with the
		<guilabel>Show GPU overdraw</guilabel>
		setting. This section adds colors to your screen based on the number
		of overdraws. The following table explains the used color schema.
