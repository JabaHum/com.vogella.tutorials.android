		<title>Using Leak Canary to find memory leaks
		
			Leak Canary can be integrated into an Android application and can detect automatically leaks of activities and
			fragments. The usage is very simple, you add it as dependency to your Gradle build file and initialize the library
			in your application class. This registers a life cycle listener for your activities and traces if their
			`destroy`
			method is called in the right point in time.
		
		
			As Leak Canary is an Open Source project it is likely to change very quickly. See
			<ulink url="https://github.com/square/leakcanary">Leak Canarys Github page</ulink>
			for instructions how to use it.

		<title>Using AndroidDevMetrics to display performance data
		
			AndroidDevMetrics you can see how fast the most common operations like object initialization
			(in Dagger 2 graph), or Activity lifecycle methods (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume()) are.
		
		
			As AndroidDevMetrics is an Open Source project. See
			<ulink url="https://github.com/frogermcs/androiddevmetrics">AndroidDevMetrics Github page</ulink>
