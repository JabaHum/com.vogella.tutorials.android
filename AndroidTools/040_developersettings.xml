		_Developer Settings_
		in your
		<guilabel>Setting</guilabel>
		application of your Android phone allow to set configurations which
		simplify the
		analysis of your application. For example you can enable
		that the touch area is highlighted.
	

	
		If you
		have a Android 4.2 phone, try going to the About section in
		the
		Settings and
		tap the
		<guilabel>Build number</guilabel>
		entry 7
		times.
	
	
		If you phone does not have this option try using an emulator.

	
	In some cases you need to restart the application to make the
		setting work.
