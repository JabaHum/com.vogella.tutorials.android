		<title>Using drag and drop in Android
		
			As of Android 4.0 drag and drop of
			view onto other views or view
			groups
			is supported.

		<title>Allowing a view to be dragged
		
			To use dragging a view you register a
			`OnTouchListener`
			or a
			`LongClickListener`
			on the
			view which can be dragged.
		
		
			The
			`startDrag`
			method of the
			`View`
			start a drag operation. In this method you also specify the data
			which is passed to the drop target via an instance of
			`ClipData`
			.
		

		
			You also pass to the
			`startDrag`
			method an instance of
			`DragShadowBuilder`
			.
			This object specifies the picture used for the drag operation. For
			example you can
			pass in the
			view
			directly, that shows an image of the
			view during the drag
			operation.
		
		The setup of this drag operation in a touch listener is
			demonstrated in the
			following
			example.

		<title>Defining drop target
		
			The views which can
			be drop targets get an instance of
			`OnDragListener`
			assigned. In this drop listener you receive call backs in case of
			predefined drag and drop related events.

			A view
			with
			`OnDragListener`
			which are used as a drop zone, gets a
			`OnDragListener`
			assigned via the
			`setOnDragListener`
			.
