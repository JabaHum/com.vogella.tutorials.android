		<title>Overview about AppWidgets
		
			_Widgets_
			are little applications which can be placed on a widget host,
			typically the
			_home screen_
			or the
			_lock screen_
			of your
			Android device.
		
		
			A widget runs as part of the
			process of its host. This requires
			that the widget
			preserves the
			permissions of their application.
		
		
			Widget
			use
			`RemoteViews`
			to create their user interface. A
			`RemoteView`
			can be executed by another process with the same permissions as the
			original application. This way the
			widget
			runs with
			the
			permissions of its defining application.
		
		
			The user interface for a
			_Widget_
			is defined by a broadcast receiver.
			This receiver
			inflates its layout
			into an object of type
			`RemoteViews`.
			This
			object is delivered to Android, which hands it over the home
			screen
			application.

		<title>Steps to create a Widget
		
			To create a widget,
			you:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					
						Define a layout file
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Create an XML file
						(`AppWidgetProviderInfo`)
						which describes the properties of the widget,
						e.g. size or the
						fixed
						update frequency.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Create a
						`BroadcastReceiver`
						which is used to build the user interface of the
						widget.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Enter the
						_Widget_
						configuration in the
						_AndroidManifest.xml_
						file.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Optional you can specify a configuration
						_activity_
						which is called once a new instance of
						the
						`widget`
						is added to the widget host.
					
				</listitem>

		<title>Widget size
		
			Before Android 3.1 a widget
			always took a fixed amount of cells
			on the home screen.
			A cell is
			usually used to display the icon of one
			application. As a
			calculation
			rule you should define the size of the
			widget with the
			formula:
			`((Number of columns / rows) * 74) - 2`.
			These are device
			independent
			pixels and the `-2` is used to avoid rounding
			errors.
		
		
			As of Android 3.1 a widget
			can be flexible in size, e.g., the
			user can
			make it larger or smaller.
			To enable this for widget,
			you can use the
			`android:resizeMode="horizontal|vertical"`
			attribute in the XML configuration file for the widget.
