			<wordasword>Widgets</wordasword>
			are little applications which can be placed on a widget host,
			typically the
			<wordasword>home screen</wordasword>
			or the
			<wordasword>lock screen</wordasword>
			of your
			Android device.
		</para>
		<para>
			A widget runs as part of the
			process of its host. This requires
			that the widget
			preserves the
			permissions of their application.
		</para>
		<para>
			Widget
			use
			<code>RemoteViews</code>
			to create their user interface. A
			<code>RemoteView</code>
			can be executed by another process with the same permissions as the
			original application. This way the
			widget
			runs with
			the
			permissions of its defining application.
		</para>
		<para>
			The user interface for a
			<wordasword>Widget</wordasword>
			is defined by a broadcast receiver.
			This receiver
			inflates its layout
			into an object of type
			<code>RemoteViews</code>.
			This
			object is delivered to Android, which hands it over the home
			screen
			application.

			Before Android 3.1 a widget
			always took a fixed amount of cells
			on the home screen.
			A cell is
			usually used to display the icon of one
			application. As a
			calculation
			rule you should define the size of the
			widget with the
			formula:
			<code>((Number of columns / rows) * 74) - 2</code>.
			These are device
			independent
			pixels and the <code>-2</code> is used to avoid rounding
			errors.
		</para>
		<para>
			As of Android 3.1 a widget
			can be flexible in size, e.g., the
			user can
			make it larger or smaller.
			To enable this for widget,
			you can use the
			<code>android:resizeMode="horizontal|vertical"</code>
			attribute in the XML configuration file for the widget.
