	<title>Enabling a app widget for the lock Screen</title>
	<para>
		Since Android 4.2, it is possible to add home screen app
		widgets
		to the
		lock screen of an Android device. To enable your widget for the look
		screen you need to add
		<parameter>keyguard</parameter>
		category in
		the
		<parameter>android:widgetCategory</parameter>
		attribute in the
		<code>AppWidgetProviderInfo</code>
		XML
		file. The following code shows an example.
	</para>
	<para>
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/lockscreen/add.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
		In this example you declare a widget to support both - the home
		and the
		lock screens. If you recompile and launch your application now,
		you
		will be able to add the widget to the lock screen already.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can also detect a widget category at runtime. For this, in the
		<code>AppWidgetProvider.onUpdate()</code>
		method, you can check for the category
		option of a widget with the
		following code.
	</para>
	<para>
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/lockscreen/check.java" />
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
		Using this technique you can decide at runtime whether the
		widgets
		your
		application provides, will look differently, when they are
		hosted on
		the
		lock screen.
	</para>
	<para>
		Similarly to how you used the
		<property>android:initialLayout</property>
		attribute for defining
		an
		initial layout for home screen widgets, you
		can use a new
		<property>android:initialKeyguardLayout</property>
		attribute for the lock screen in the
		<code>AppWidgetProviderInfo</code>
		XML file. This layout will appear immediately
		after a widget is added
		and will be replaced by the real layout once the
		widget is initialized.
