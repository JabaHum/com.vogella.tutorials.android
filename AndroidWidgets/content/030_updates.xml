	<title>Widget updates
	
		A widget
		gets its data on a periodic timetable. There are two methods
		to update
		a widget, one is based on an XML configuration
		file and the
		other is
		based on the Android
		`AlarmManager`
		service.
	
	
		In the widget configuration file you can specify a fixed update
		interval. The system will wake up after this time interval and call
		your broadcast receiver to update the widget. The smallest update
		interval is 1800000 milliseconds (30 minutes).
	
	
		The
		`AlarmManager`
		allows you
		to be more resource efficient and to have a higher
		frequency
		of
		updates. To use this approach, you define a service
		and schedule this
		service
		via the
		`AlarmManager`
		regularly. This service updates the widget.
	
	
		Please note that a higher update frequency will wake up the phone
		from the energy safe mode. As a result your widget consumes more
		energy.
