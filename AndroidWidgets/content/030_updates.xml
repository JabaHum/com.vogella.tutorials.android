		A widget
		gets its data on a periodic timetable. There are two methods
		to update
		a widget, one is based on an XML configuration
		file and the
		other is
		based on the Android
		<code>AlarmManager</code>
		service.
	</para>
	<para>
		In the widget configuration file you can specify a fixed update
		interval. The system will wake up after this time interval and call
		your broadcast receiver to update the widget. The smallest update
		interval is 1800000 milliseconds (30 minutes).
	</para>
	<para>
		The
		<code>AlarmManager</code>
		allows you
		to be more resource efficient and to have a higher
		frequency
		of
		updates. To use this approach, you define a service
		and schedule this
		service
		via the
		<code>AlarmManager</code>
		regularly. This service updates the widget.
	</para>
	<para>
		Please note that a higher update frequency will wake up the phone
		from the energy safe mode. As a result your widget consumes more
		energy.
