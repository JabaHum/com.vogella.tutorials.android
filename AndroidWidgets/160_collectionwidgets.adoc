== Collection View Widgets
	
Collection view widgets
add support for the usage of the
`ListView`,
`StackView`
and
`GridView`
classes in widgets.
	
For collection view widgets
you need two layout files, one for the
widget and one for each item in the
widget collection.
	
The widget
items are filled by an instance of the
`RemoteViewsFactory`
factory class.
	
This factory class is provided by an Android service
which extends the
`RemoteViewsService`
class. This service requires the
`android.permission.BIND_REMOTEVIEWS`
permission.
	
To connect your views
with the service,
you use your
`onUpdate()`
method in your widget implementation.
	
You define an intent
pointing to the service
and use the
`setRemoteAdapter`
method on the
`RemoteViews`
class.
