is a light weight library to inject views into Android components.
	
The
`@Bind`
annotation allow to inject views and performs the cast to the correct type for you. The
`@@OnClick(R.id.yourid)`
annotation allows to add OnClickListener to a view. You can optional define the method parameter of the view in case you want it injected.
