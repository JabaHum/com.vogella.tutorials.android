		To use UI Automator for your tests, add the following dependency to the Gradle build file of your app.
			You must also specify the
			`AndroidJUnitRunner`
			as value for the
			<parameter>testInstrumentationRunner</parameter>
			parameter in the build.gradle file of your app. The following listing is an example for that.
