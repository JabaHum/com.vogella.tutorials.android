== Making UI Automator available

=== Configuration in your project

To use UI Automator for your tests, add the following dependency to the Gradle build file of your app.
You must also specify the
`AndroidJUnitRunner`
as value for the
`testInstrumentationRunner`
parameter in the build.gradle file of your app. The following listing is an example for that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/uiautomator/androidjunitrunner.java[]
----

It is also recommended turning of the animation on the Android device which is used for testing. _

=== Location of your tests

UI Automator tests must be located by default in the
_app/src/androidTest_
folder.

=== Wrting test

Similar to Espresso tests, UI Automator tests should be annotated with the
`@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)`
test runner and use
`ActivityTestRule` to configure itself.
