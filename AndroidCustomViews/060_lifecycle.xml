		<title>Life cycle events related to the window
		A view is displayed if it is attached to a layout hierarchy
			which is attached to a window. A view has several life cycle hooks.
		
		
			The
			`onAttachedToWindow()`
			is called once the window is available.
		
		
			The
			`onDetachedFromWindow()`
			is used when the view is removed from its parent (and if the parent
			is
			attached to a window). This happens for example if the activity is
			recycled (e.g. via the
			`finished()`
			method call) or if the view is recycled in a
			`ListView`
			.

			The
			`onDetachedFromWindow()`
			method can be used to stop animations and to clean up resources used
			by the view.

			All views must know how to measure and layout themselves. The
			`requestLayout()`
			method call tells the view to measure and layout itself. As this
			operation may influence the layout of other views it calls also
			`requestLayout()`
			of its parent.
		
		<tip>
			This recursive call is the reason why you should not nestle
				layout to deeply as the measure and layout operation might be
				expensive if a lot of hierarchies are re-calculated.
			
		</tip>
		
			The
			`onMeasure()`
			method determines the size for the view and its children. It must set
			the dimension via the
			`setMeasuredDimension()`
			method is this method call before returning.
		
		
			The
			`onLayout()`
			positions the views based on the result of the
			`onMeasure()`
			method call. This call happens typically once, which
			`onMeasure()`
			can happens once.

		<title>Activity life cycle
		Views don't have access to the life cycle events of the
			activities. If views want to get informed about these events you
			should create an interface in the view which you call in the
			life
			cycle methods of the activity.
