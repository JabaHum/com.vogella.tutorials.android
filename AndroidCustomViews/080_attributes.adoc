== Define additional attributes for your custom Views
	
You can define additional attributes for your compound or custom views.
To define additional attributes create an _attrs.xml_ file in your _res/values_ folder. 
The following shows an example of attributes defined for a new view called `ColorOptionsView`.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res//attributes/attrs.xml[]
----
	
To use these attributes in your layout file you have to declare them in the XML header. 
In the following listing this is done via the `xmlns:custom` part of the code. 
These attributes are also assigned to the view.
	

[source,xml]
----
include::res/attributes/activity_main.xml[]
----	


The following example shows how you components can access these attributes.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/attributes/ColorOptionsView.java[]
