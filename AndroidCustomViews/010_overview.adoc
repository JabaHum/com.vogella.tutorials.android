		<title>Default views
		
			The Android framework provides several default views but
			developer can
			also create their custom views and use them in their
			application. The
			base class a view is the

	<section id="customviews_howandroiddraws">
		<title>How Android draws the view hierarchy
		Once an Activity receives the focus, it must provide the root
			node of its layout hierarchy to the Android system. Afterwards the
			Android system starts the drawing procedure.
		
		Drawing begins with the root node of the layout. The layout
			hierarchy is traversed in the order of declaration, i.e., parents are
			drawn before their children and children are drawn in the order of
			declaration.
		
		
			Drawing the layout is a two pass process:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					
						measuring pass - implemented in the
						`measure(int, int)`
						method
						and is a top-down traversal of the view hierarchy. Every
						view stores its measurements.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						layout pass - implemented in the
						`layout(int, int, int, int)`
						method

						is also a
						top-down traversal of the view hierarchy. During
						this phase
						each layout manager is responsible for
						positioning
						all of
						its children. It uses
						the sizes computed in the
						measure
						pass.
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		
		<note>
			The measure and layout step always happen together.
		</note>
		<note>
			Layout managers can run the measure pass several times. For example
			`LinearLayout`
			supports the weight attribute which distributes the remaining empty
			space among views and
			`RelativeLayout`
			measures child views several times to solve constraints given in the
			layout file.
		</note>
		
			A view or activity can retrigger the measure and layout pass with a
			call to the
			`requestLayout()`
			method.
		
		
			After the measure and layout calculation, the views draw
			themselves.
			This operation can be
			triggered with the invalidate() method from the
			`View`
			class.

			http://source.android.com/devices/graphics/architecture.html[Android Graphical Architecture]
			article.
		
	

	<section id="customviews_reasonsforcreating">
		<title>Reasons for creating views
		View are typically created to provide a user interface
			experience with is not possible with the default views. Using custom
			view allows the developer allow to do certain performance
			optimization, i.e., in case of a custom layout the development can
			optimize the layout manager for his use case.
		
	

	<section id="customviews_purpose">
		<title>Responsibility of views
		
			Views
			are responsible for
			measuring, layouting and drawing themselves
			and
			their child elements
			(in case of a
			`ViewGroup`
			). Views are also
			responsible for saving their
			UI state and handling
			touch events.
		

	

	<section id="customviews_type">
		<title>Ways of creating custom views
		
			Customs
			views are typically classified as compound views or
			custom
			views. It is possible to create custom views by:

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					Compound views
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Custom views
						<itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								By extending an existing view
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								By extending the View class
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist>
					
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
		

	


	<section id="customviews_layoutfiles">
		<title>Using new views in layout files
		Custom and
			compound views can be used in layout files. For this
			you need to use
			the full qualified name in the layout file, e.g. using
			the package and
			class name.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					href="./examples/layout/main.xml" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
		
		TIP:
			Alternatively you can also declare
				you name space in the layout
				file, similar to the Android name
				space.

		<title>Create screenshots

			Every
