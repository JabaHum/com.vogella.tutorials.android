	<title>Persisting View data</title>
	<para>
		Most standard
		view
		can save there state so that it can be persisted by
		the system. The Android system calls the
		<code>onSaveInstanceState()</code>
		method and the
		<code>onRestoreInstanceState(Parcable)</code>
		to save and restore the view state.
	</para>
	<para>
		The convention is to extend
		<code>View.BasedSavedState</code>
		as a static inner class in the view for persisting the data.
	</para>
	<para>
		Android
		searches based on the ID of
		the
		view
		in the layout for the
		view
		and
		pass a
		<code>Bundle</code>
		to the
		view
		which the
		view
		can use to restore its state.
	</para>
	<para>You should save and restore the user interface state as the user
		left it, e.g. the scroll position or the active selection.
