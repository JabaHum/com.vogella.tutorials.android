		Compound views (also known as
		<wordasword>Compound Components</wordasword>
		) are  pre-configured
		<code>ViewGroups</code>
		based on existing views
		with
		some
		predefined view interaction.
	</para>
	<para>Combound views also allow you to add custom API to update and
		query the state of the combound view.

		For such a control you define a layout
		file and assign it to your
		compound view. In the implementation of
		your compound view you
		predefine the
		view
		interaction.
		You would define a layout file and extend
		the corresponding
		<code>ViewGroup</code>
		class. In this class you inflate the layout file and implement the
		<code>View</code>
		connection logic

			For performance reasons you may want to rewrite your combound
			view to
			a custom view which extends
			<code>View</code>
			. This may you can typically flatten your view hierarchy. Drawing the
			view requires in this case less traversals and this can be
			significantly faster if implemented correctly.
