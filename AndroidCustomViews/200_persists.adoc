	<title>Persisting View data
	
		Most standard
		view
		can save there state so that it can be persisted by
		the system. The Android system calls the
		`onSaveInstanceState()`
		method and the
		`onRestoreInstanceState(Parcable)`
		to save and restore the view state.
	
	
		The convention is to extend
		`View.BasedSavedState`
		as a static inner class in the view for persisting the data.
	
	
		Android
		searches based on the ID of
		the
		view
		in the layout for the
		view
		and
		pass a
		`Bundle`
		to the
		view
		which the
		view
		can use to restore its state.
	
	You should save and restore the user interface state as the user
		left it, e.g. the scroll position or the active selection.
