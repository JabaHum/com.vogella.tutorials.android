	<title>Activity animations in Android with shared views
	Android 5.0 adds the capability to animate between activities and to have shared views between these activity. If you define a shared
		part the old view with be animating into the position and size of the new view.
	
	
		To test this create a project with the top level package called
		`com.vogella.android.activityanimationwithsharedviews`
		.
	
	
		Create two activity with two different layout, both containing a
		`ImageView`
		with the same
		`android:transitionName`
		property.
	
	activity_main.xml
	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/activities/activity_main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	


	activity_second.xml

	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/activities/activity_second.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	Adjust your activity code.
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/activities/MainActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/activities/SecondActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		If you run your application and click on the image view, it is animated to the view with the same
		`android:transitionName`
		property, in our case the button.
