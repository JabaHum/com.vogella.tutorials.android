== Activity animations in Android with shared views

Android 5.0 adds the capability to animate between activities and to have shared views between these activity. If you define a shared
part the old view with be animating into the position and size of the new view.
	
To test this create a project with the top level package called
`com.vogella.android.activityanimationwithsharedviews`.
	
Create two activity with two different layout, both containing a
`ImageView`
with the same
`android:transitionName`
property.

activity_main.xml
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/activities/activity_main.xml[]
----	

activity_second.xml

[source,xml]
----
include::res/activities/activity_second.xml[]
----
	
Adjust your activity code.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/activities/MainActivity.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/activities/SecondActivity.java[]
----	
	
If you run your application and click on the image view, it is animated to the view with the same
`android:transitionName`
property, in our case the button.
