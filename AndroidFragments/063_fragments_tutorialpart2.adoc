== Exercise: Use different number of fragments depending on the configuration

=== Target of this exercise

The _RssfeedActivity_ should use a special layout file in portrait mode.
In this exercise you define the corresponding layout files.

=== Create layouts for portrait mode
		
Create the following _activity_rssfeed.xml_ layout file based on the `port` resource qualifier for orientation.
See <<androidstudio_creatingresourcefile>> for information how to do this.
		
<programlisting language="xml">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/fragments/activity_rssfeed2.xml" />
</programlisting>
		
		
Also create a new layout file called _activity_detail.xml_. 
This
layout will be used by an activity which shows the detailed fragment in portrait mode.
Please note that we could
have
created this file also in the
_res/layout_
folder, but it is only used
in portrait mode hence we place it into
this folder.
		
		
<programlisting language="xml">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/fragments/activity_detail.xml" />
</programlisting>
		
=== Define a boolean flag dependent of the resource selector

Create a file in your _res/values_ folder called _config.xml_ with the following setting.
		
<programlisting language="java">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/mode/config.xml" />
</programlisting>
		
		
Create the same file in your _res/values-land_ folder with a different value.
		
<programlisting language="java">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/mode/config2.xml" />
</programlisting>

=== Create class for new activity
		
Create a new activity called `DetailActivity` with the following class.
		
		
<programlisting language="java">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/fragments/DetailActivity.java" />
</programlisting>
		
=== Register new class as activity via the manifest
		
Ensure that the activity is registered in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.
		
<programlisting language="java">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/fragments/AndroidManifest.xml" />
</programlisting>
		
=== Adjust the RssfeedActivity activity
		
Adjust the `RssfeedActivity` class to display the `DetailActivity` in case the other fragment is not present in the layout.
		
<programlisting language="java">
	<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/fragments/RssfeedActivity2.java" />
</programlisting>
		

=== Validate your implementation
		
Test your application. 
If you run the application in portrait mode, you should see only one fragment. 
In horizontal mode you see both fragments.
		
Use the 
<keycombo>
	<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
	<keycap>F11</keycap>
</keycombo>
shortcut to switch the orientation. 
Press the button in portrait as well as in horizontal mode and verify that the detail activity shows the current time.
