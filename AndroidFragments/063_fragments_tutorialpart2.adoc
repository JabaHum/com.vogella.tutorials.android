== Exercise: Use different number of fragments depending on the configuration

=== Target of this exercise

The _RssfeedActivity_ should show two fragments (two panes) if started in landscape mode.
In this exercise you adjust your application to support this.

=== Create activity layout for portrait mode
		
Create the following _activity_rssfeed.xml_ layout file based on the `port` resource qualifier for orientation.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/activity_rssfeed2.xml[]
----

=== Define a boolean flag dependent of the resource selector

Create a file in your _res/values_ folder called _config.xml_ with the following setting.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/mode/config.xml[]
----	
	
Create the same file in your _res/values-land_ folder with a different value.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/mode/config2.xml[]
----

=== Adjust the RssfeedActivity activity
		
Adjust the `RssfeedActivity` class to replace the existing fragment in case you are in single pane mode.


[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/RssfeedActivity2.java[]
----	

=== Validate your implementation
		
Test your application. 
If you run the application in portrait mode, you should see only one fragment. 
In horizontal mode you see both fragments.
		
Switch the orientation of the emulator.
Press the button in portrait as well as in horizontal mode and verify that the detail activity shows the current time.
