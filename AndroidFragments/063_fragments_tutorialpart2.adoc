== Exercise: Use different number of fragments depending on the configuration

=== Target of this exercise

The _RssfeedActivity_ should use a special layout file in portrait mode.
In this exercise you define the corresponding layout files.

=== Create activity layout for portrait mode
		
Create the following _activity_rssfeed.xml_ layout file based on the `port` resource qualifier for orientation.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/activity_rssfeed2.xml[]
----

		
Also create a new layout file called _activity_detail.xml_. 
This layout is be used by an activity which shows the detailed fragment in portrait mode.
Please note that we could have created this file also in the _res/layout_ folder, but it is only used in portrait mode hence we place it into
this folder.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/activity_detail.xml[]
----	
	
=== Define a boolean flag dependent of the resource selector

Create a file in your _res/values_ folder called _config.xml_ with the following setting.

		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/mode/config.xml[]
----	
	
		
Create the same file in your _res/values-land_ folder with a different value.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/mode/config2.xml[]
----

=== Create class for new activity
		
Create a new activity called `DetailActivity` with the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/DetailActivity.java[]
----	
		
=== Register new class as activity via the manifest
		
Ensure that the activity is registered in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
		
=== Adjust the RssfeedActivity activity
		
Adjust the `RssfeedActivity` class to display the `DetailActivity` in case the other fragment is not present in the layout.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/RssfeedActivity2.java[]
----	

=== Validate your implementation
		
Test your application. 
If you run the application in portrait mode, you should see only one fragment. 
In horizontal mode you see both fragments.
		
Use the kbd:[Ctrl+F11] shortcut to switch the orientation. 
Press the button in portrait as well as in horizontal mode and verify that the detail activity shows the current time.
