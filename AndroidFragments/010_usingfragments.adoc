== Defining and using fragments

=== Defining fragments
		
To define a new fragment you either extend the `android.app.Fragment` class or one of its subclasses.
Subclasses are for example, `ListFragment`, `DialogFragment`, `PreferenceFragment` or `WebViewFragment`. 
The following code shows an example implementation.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/DetailFragment.java[]
----

=== Application communication with fragments
		
To increase reuse of fragments, they should not directly communicate with each other. 
Every communication of the fragments should be done via the host activity.
		
		
For this purpose a fragment should define an interface as an inner type.
The fragment requires that the activity, which uses it, must implement this interface. 
This way you avoid that the fragment has any knowledge about the activity which uses it. 
In its `onAttach()` method it can check if the _activity_ correctly implements this interface.
		
For example, assume you have a fragment which should communicate a value to its parent activity. 
This can be implemented like the following.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/communication/MyListFragment.java[]
