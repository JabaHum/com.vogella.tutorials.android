== Persisting data in fragments

=== Persisting data between application restarts
		
Frequently in your Android application you need to persist your application data. For this, you can for example
use an
SQLite database or a file.
		

=== Persisting data between configurations changes
		
If you want to persist data between configuration changes, you
can also use the application object.
		
		
In addition to that you can use the `setRetainState(true)` method call on the fragment. 
This retains the fragment instances between configuration changes.
It only works if the fragments are not added to the backstack. 
In this case the data must be stored as member (field).

[NOTE]
====
Using this method is not recommended by Google for fragments which have a user interface. 
See <<headlessfragments1>>.
====

You can use the `onSaveInstanceState()` method to place the data in the `Bundle`.
You can retrieve that data the `onActivityCreated()` method.
