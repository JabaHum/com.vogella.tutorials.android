== Animations for fragment transitions
	
During a fragment transaction, you can define animations based on the _Property Animation_ API via the `setCustomAnimations()` method.
	
You can also use several standard Android animations via the `setTransition()` method call.
These are defined via the constants starting with `FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_*`.
	
Both methods allow you to define an entry animation and an existing animation.
