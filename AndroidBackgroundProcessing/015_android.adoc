== Concurrency constructs in Android
	
Android provides additional constructs to handle concurrently in
comparison with standard Java.

You can use the
`android.os.Handler`
class or the
`AsyncTasks`
classes. More sophisticated approach are based on the
`Loader`
class, retained Fragments and services.
