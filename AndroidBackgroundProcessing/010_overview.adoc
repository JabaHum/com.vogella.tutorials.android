== Android's user interface thread

=== Main thread
		
Android
modifies the user interface and handles input events from one
single
_user interface thread_
. This thread is
also called the
_main thread_
.
				
Android collects all events in a queue and processed an instance of
the
`Looper`
class.

=== Why using concurrency?
		
If the
programmer does not use any concurrency
constructs, all
code
of
an
Android
application
runs in the main thread and every statement
is
executed after each other.
		
If
you perform a long
lasting operation, for example accessing
data
from
the Internet, the application
blocks
until
the corresponding
operation has
finished.
		
To provide a good user experience all
potentially slow
running
operations in an
Android
application should
run asynchronously, e.g. via
some way of
concurrency constructs of the Java
language or the Android
framework. This includes all potential slow operations, like
network,
file and database
access and
complex calculations.
		
NOTE: Android enforces a worst case reaction time of applications.
If an _activity_ does not react within 5 seconds to user input, the Android system displays an _Application not responding_ (ANR) dialog. 
From this dialog the user can choose to stop the application.
