== Using Java threading constructs in Android

=== Using Java threads and thread pools 
		
Android
supports the usage of the
`Thread`
class to perform asynchronous processing.
		
Android also supplies the
`java.util.concurrent`
package
to perform something in the background, e.g. using the
`ThreadPools`
and
`Executor`
classes.
		
If
you need to update the user interface from a new
`Thread`
, you need to synchronize with the
_user interface thread_.
		
=== Disadvantages of using Java threads in Android
		
If you use Java threading in Android applications, you have to handle the following
requirements
in your custom code:

* Synchronization with the main thread, if you post back results to the user interface
* No default for canceling the thread
* No default thread pooling
* No default for handling configuration changes in Android

Because of these restrictions, Android developer typically use Android specific code constructs.
