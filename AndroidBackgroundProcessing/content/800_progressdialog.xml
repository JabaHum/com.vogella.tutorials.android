	<title>Feedback via dialog
	
		If you are performing a long running operation it is good
		practice to provide feedback to the user about the running operation.
	

	
		You can provide progress feedback via the
		_action bar_
		for example via an
		_action view_
		. Alternatively you can use a
		`ProgressBar`
		in your layout which you set to visible and update it during a long
		running operation. This approach is called
		_providing inline feedback_
		as it leave the user interface responsive.
	
	
		To block the user interface during the operation you can use the
		`ProgressBar`
		dialog, which allows the display of progress to the user. The
		Javadoc
		of
		`ProgressBar`
		gives a nice example of its usage.
	
	<tip>
		
			Avoid using the
			`ProgressBar`
			dialog or similar approaches if possible. Prefer providing
			inline
			feedback to that your
			user interface stays responsive.
