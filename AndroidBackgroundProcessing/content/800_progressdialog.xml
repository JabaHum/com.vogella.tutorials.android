	<title>Feedback via dialog</title>
	<para>
		If you are performing a long running operation it is good
		practice to provide feedback to the user about the running operation.
	</para>

	<para>
		You can provide progress feedback via the
		<wordasword>action bar</wordasword>
		for example via an
		<wordasword>action view</wordasword>
		. Alternatively you can use a
		<code>ProgressBar</code>
		in your layout which you set to visible and update it during a long
		running operation. This approach is called
		<wordasword>providing inline feedback</wordasword>
		as it leave the user interface responsive.
	</para>
	<para>
		To block the user interface during the operation you can use the
		<code>ProgressBar</code>
		dialog, which allows the display of progress to the user. The
		Javadoc
		of
		<code>ProgressBar</code>
		gives a nice example of its usage.
	</para>
	<tip>
		<para>
			Avoid using the
			<code>ProgressBar</code>
			dialog or similar approaches if possible. Prefer providing
			inline
			feedback to that your
			user interface stays responsive.
