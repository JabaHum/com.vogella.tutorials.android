		is an extension of the Android test framework and was
		created
		to make
		it
		easy to write
		user interface tests for
		Android
		applications.
		Robotium
		tests inherit from
		<code>ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2</code>
		and
		allows you to define test
		cases
		across
		Android
		activities.

	<note>
		<para>Robotium tests perceive the application under test as black box,
			i.e., it only interacts with the user interface
			and not via the
			internal code of the application.
