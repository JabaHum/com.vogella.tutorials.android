== Example for data binding usage
	
Layout files which supports data binding start with a _layout_ root tag followed by a _data_ element and a _view_ root element. 
This view element is what your root would be in a non-binding layout file. 
The data elements describe data which is available for binding, expressions within the layout are written in the attribute properties using the `“@{}”` syntax.
	
A sample file looks like the following listing.
	

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/main_layout.xml[]
----
	
The user variable within data describes a property that may be used within this layout.

The data object used with this layout may look like the following listing.

	
[source,java]
----
include::res/User.java[]
----
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/usage.java[]
