		Every
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html[Android Application]
		runs as its own process. Also a own Linux user is automatically
		created for each application.
	
	 By default Android applications run inside a process with
		no
		permissions assigned. Therefore the application can not access the
		system or any resources. Android applications can request
		permissions
		via the <filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename> file.
