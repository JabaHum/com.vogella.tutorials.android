		<para>
			Android is an operating system based on a modified
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Ubuntu/article.html">Linux</ulink>
			2.6
			with a
			<ulink

			programming interface. Also several drivers and libraries have been
			modified to allow Android to run efficient on mobile devices.

		</para>

		<para>

			It provides tools, e.g. a compiler, debugger
			and a device
			emulator as
			well as its own Java Virtual machine
			(Dalvik
			Virtual Machine
			- DVM).
			Android
			is
			created by the
			Open Handset Alliance
			which is led
			by
			Google.
		</para>

		<para>
			Android uses a special virtual machine, e.g. the Dalvik Virtual
			Machine. Dalvik uses
			special
			bytecode. Therefore you cannot run
			standard Java bytecode on
			Android.
			Android provides a tool "dx" which
			allows to convert Java
			Class
			files
			into "dex" (Dalvik Executable) files.
			Android applications
			are
			packed into an .apk (Android Package) file by
			the program "aapt" (Android Asset Packaging Tool). To
			simplify
			development Google provides the Android Developer Tools
			(ADT) for
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html"> Eclipse</ulink>
			. The ADT performs automatically the conversion from class to dex
			files and creates the apk during deployment.
