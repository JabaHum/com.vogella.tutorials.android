== Writing tests for the presenter

Typically the presenter has dependencies, for example to the implementation of the view contract.
You mock or fake these dependencies away to unit test the presenter.

For example, to test the presenter we do not need to know if the view displays a dialog or progress indicator.
But we want to test that presenter calls a method on the view to display the progress information.
