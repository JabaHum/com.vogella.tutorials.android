== Android Camera
	
Most Android devices have at least one camera. Some devices have
a front and
a back facing camera.
	
Using the camera on the Android device can be done via the
integration
of existing camera application. In this case you would start the
existing Camera application via an
_intent_
and use the return data of the application to access the result.
	
Alternatively you can also directly integrate the camera into your
application via
the
`Camera`
API.
	
The following description contains examples for both use cases.
