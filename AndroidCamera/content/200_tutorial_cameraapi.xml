== Tutorial: Using the camera API
In this tutorial you create application which allows you to make a photo via the front camera and to save it on the SD card.
	
	TIP:
		If you
			using
			the Android emulator ensure that you configured the
			camera and that you added an SD card
			during
			the creation of the your
			Android virtual device.
		
	</tip>
	
	
		Create a new Android project called
		_de.vogella.camera.api_
		with an
		_activity_
		called
		`MakePhotoActivity`
		.
	
	
		Add the
		`android.permission.CAMERA`
		permission to access your camera and the
		`android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
		to be able to write to the SD card to your
		_AndroidManifest.xml_
		file.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/cameraapi/AndroidManifest.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		Change the
		_main.xml_
		file in the
		<filename class="directory">res/layout_
		folder to the
		following
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/cameraapi/simple.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Create the following
		`PhotoHandler`
		class which will be responsible for saving the photo the SD card.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/cameraapi/PhotoHandler.java" />
		</programlisting>
	


	
		Change the
		`MakePhotoActivity
		`
		class to the following. This class assumes that you have a button
		in
		your layout with the
		`onClick`
		property pointing to a
		`onClick()`
		method.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/cameraapi/MakePhotoActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
