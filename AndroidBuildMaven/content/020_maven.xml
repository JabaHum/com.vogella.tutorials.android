	<title>Building Android applications with Maven
	
		The
		_android-maven-plugin_
		plug-in allows to build Android
		applications via
		Maven.
	
	
		The webpage of this maven plug-in is located under:
		http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/[Android-Maven Plug-in]
		.
	
	
		The Eclipse support of this plug-in is provided by the
		https://github.com/rgladwell/m2e-android[m2e project]
		.
	
	
		You only have to install Maven, write a correct
		_pom.xml_
		file and issue
		the commands to Maven to build, install and run your
		application.
	
	The following will build your Android application via Maven.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/make.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		This will create the application and places the
		_.apk_
		file in the
		<filename class="directory">target_
		folder.
	

	If you want to install the application via Maven on your Android
		device, you can use the
		following command.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/install.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	
	If more then one device is
		available you can specify the relevant
		device in your pom.xml. Maven
		can also start and stop an Android
		virtual device automatically for
		you.
	

	You can also start the application via Maven.
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/run.txt" />
		</programlisting>
