== Tutorial: Building Android Applications with Maven

Create a new Android project called
"de.vogella.android.build.firstmaven". The actual content of the
repository is not important as we are only using this project to
create a working build for Maven.

Create the following "pom.xml" file in your directory. Make sure
that artifactId is set to your project name.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/pom.xml[]
----

Switch to the command line and enter the following command:

[source,java]
----
include::res/install.txt[]
