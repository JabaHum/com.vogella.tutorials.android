	<title>Calendar API
	 The Calendar API is available as of Android 4.0.
	
		Creating new events is done via
		_Intents_
		and does not require any permission. Setting properties of the event
		is done via Intent extras. The user will be prompted if the
		event
		should be
		created.
	
	 For example the following will prompt the user if an event
		should be created with certain details.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/snippets/createevent.java" />
		</programlisting>
	

	You can also add dates and time, if this event is repeated and
		the like. See the comments in the coding for examples.
