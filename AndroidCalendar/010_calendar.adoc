== Calendar API

The Calendar API is available as of Android 4.0.

Creating new events is done via
_Intents_
and does not require any permission. Setting properties of the event
is done via Intent extras. The user will be prompted if the
event
should be
created.

For example the following will prompt the user if an event
should be created with certain details.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/createevent.java[]
----

You can also add dates and time, if this event is repeated and
the like. See the comments in the coding for examples.
