		development. This section gives
		an overview over typical problems and
		how to solve them.
	
	<section id="androidproblemresolution_clean">
		<title>Clean Project
		
			Several users report
			that they get the following errors:
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					Project ... is missing required source folder: 'gen'   
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					The project could not be built until build path errors are
						resolved.

					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Unable to open class file R.java.
					
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
		
		
			To solve any of these errors, go to the project menu and select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Project</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Clean</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			.
		
		If you have library projects, make sure to clean them too.
		

	
	<section id="androidproblemresolution_activitiynotfoudn">
		<title>android.content.ActivityNotFoundException
		
			During start or during execution of your application, your
			application stops. In
			the
			<guilabel>LogCat</guilabel>
			view
			you see the message:
			_android.content.ActivityNotFoundException :
				Unable to find
				explicit activity class; have you declared this
				activity in your
				AndroidManifest.xml?
			_
		
		
			Check in this case if you declared your
			_activity_
			in the
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file.
		
	
	<section id="androidproblemresolution_adb">
		<title>Problems with Android Debug Bridge (adb)
		 The communication with the emulator or your Android device
			might have problems. This communication is handled by the Android
			Debug Bridge (adb).
		
		
			Eclipse allows you to reset the adb in case this causes problems.
			Select
			therefore the DDMS perspective via
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Window</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Open Perspective</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>Other...</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>DDMS</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
		
		
			To restart the adb, select the "Reset adb" in the Device
			`View`
			.

			If this does not work, locate the
			<filename>adb</filename>
			and type the commands
			`adb kill-server`
			followed by an
			`adb start-server`.
		
	
	<section id="androidproblemresolution_logcat">
		<title>LogCat
		
			The
			<guilabel>LogCat</guilabel>
			view
			shows you the log messages of your Android device and helps
			you to
			analyze
			problems. For example Java exceptions in your
			program would be
			shown
			here. To open this view, select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Window</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Show View</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>Other...</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>Android</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>LogCat</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			.
		
	
	<section id="androidproblemresolution_java7">
		<title>Java7
		
			If Android complains that you cannot use Java7 select your
			right-click on your project
			and select the
			<guilabel>Java Compiler</guilabel>
			entry. Ensure that Java 1.5 or Java 1.6 is used. You may have to
			select the
			<guilabel>Enable project specific settings</guilabel>
			checkbox.

	<section id="androidproblemresolution_r">
		<title>Eclipse reports file from R.java as missing

		
			Sometimes Eclipse complains that a file, e.g.
			<filename>R.layout.main</filename>
			cannot be found. Check in your source code that you did not import
			`android.R`
			. An
			`android.R`
			import will prevent Eclipse from finding your
			<filename>R</filename>
			file.
