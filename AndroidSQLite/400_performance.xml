	Changes in SQLite are ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated,
		durable). This means that every update, insert and delete operation is
		ACID. Unfortunately this requires some overhead in the database
		processing therefore you should wrap updates in the SQLite database in
		an transaction and commit this transaction after several operations.
		This can significantly improve performance.
	
	The following code demonstrates that performance optimization.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/performance/update.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		For larger data updates you should use the
		`yieldIfContededSafely()`
		method. SQLite locks the database during an transaction. With this
		call, Android checks if someone else queries the data and if finish
		automatically the transaction and opens a new one. This way the other
		process can access the data in between.
