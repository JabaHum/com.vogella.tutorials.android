== Parceable
	
		A
		_Parceable_
		is the Android implementation of the Java Serializable. As it assume a
		certain structure and way of processing it is relatively fast compared
		to the standard Java serialization.
	
	
		To allow your custom object to be parsed to another component they
		need to implement the
		`android.os.Parcelable`
		interface. It must also provide a static final method called
		`CREATOR`
		which must implement the
		`Parcelable.Creator`
		interface.

			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

	Once you have defined this, you can put it into the extra of an
		intent.
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/parcel/intent.java[]

	To access the parcel on the other side, you can use the following
		example code.
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/parcel/getParcel.java[]
