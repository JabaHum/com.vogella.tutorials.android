		The display of elements in a list is a very common pattern in
		mobile
		applications. The user sees a list of items and can scroll
		through
		them. Such an activity is depicted in the following picture.

		Typically the user interacts with the list via the
		toolbar, for example, via a button which refreshes the list. Individual list items can
		be
		selected. This selection can update
		the
		toolbar or
		can
		trigger a
		detailed screen for the selection. The following graphic sketches
		that. On the selection of a list item another activity is started.
