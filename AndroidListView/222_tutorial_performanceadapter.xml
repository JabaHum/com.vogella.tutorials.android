=== Performance Optimization
		 The following will implement a performance optimized version of
			the adapter from the previous example.
		
		
			Create the following
			`MyPerformanceArrayAdapter`
			class.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/layoutinflator/MyPerformanceArrayAdapter.java[]
----
		
		
			Use your new adapter in your
			_activity_
			. If you run the application it should look the same but it will be
			much faster, especially for large datasets.
