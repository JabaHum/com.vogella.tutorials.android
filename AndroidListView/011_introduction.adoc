		<title>Views for handling lists
		
			Android provides the
			`ListView`
			and the
			`ExpandableListView`
			classes
			which is capable of displaying a scrollable list of items.
			The
			`ExpandableListView`
			class
			supports a grouping of items.
		
	
	<section id="androidlists_inputtype">
		<title>Possible input types for lists
		
			The input to the list (items in the list) can
			be arbitrary Java
			objects. The adapter extracts the correct data from the data object
			and assigns
			this data to the
			_views_
			in the row of the
			`ListView`
			.
		
		
			These items are
			typically called the
			_data model_
			of the list.
			An adapter can receive data as input.
		

	


	<section id="androidlists_adapterintro">
		<title>Adapters
		
			An
			_adapter_
			manages the data model and adapts it to the individual entries in the widget. An adapter extends the
			`BaseAdapter`
			class.
		
		
			Every line in the widget displaying the data consists of a layout which can
			be as
			complex as you want. A typical line in a list has an image
			on the
			left side and two text lines in the middle as depicted in the
			following graphic.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/listview_line10.png"/>
				
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Listview example layout</phrase>
				</textobject>
			
		
		
			A layout file for a such a line might look like the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/rowlayout_complex.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			The adapter would inflate the layout for each row in its
			`getView()`
			method
			and assign the data to the individual views in the row.
		
		
			The adapter is assigned to the
			`ListView`
			via the
			`setAdapter`
			method on the
			`ListView`
			object.
		
		TIP:
			
				Adapters are not only used by `ListView`, but also by other views which
				extend `AdapterView` as, for example,
				`Spinner`
				,
				`GridView`
				,
				`Gallery`
				and
				`StackView`
				.
			
		</tip>
	
	<section id="androidlists_filtersort">
		<title>Filtering and sorting
		
			Filtering and sorting of the data is handled by the adapter. You
			need to
			implement the logic in your custom adapter implementation.
		

	

	<section id="adapterown_updates">
		<title>Data updates in the adapter

		
			The
			`notifyDataSetChanged()`
			method on the adapter is called if the data has changed or if new
			data is available.
		
		
			The
			`notifyDataSetInvalidated()`
			method is called if the data is not available anymore.
		
	

	<section id="listview_adapterlistener">
		<title>Listener
		
			To react to selections in the list, set an `OnItemClickListener` to
			your
			`ListView`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/onitemclicklistener.java" />
