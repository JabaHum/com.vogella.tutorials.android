		Sometimes having to press a refresh button on the ActionBar to
		refresh
		data can be annoying for the user. Chris Banes has implemented
		an Open
		Source
		library to implement the pull to refresh
		pattern for a
		<code>Listview</code>
		. https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh.

		Also you may want to use the swipe to dismiss gesture to delete
		items
		from a ListView. Roman Nurik provides an example for this at
		<ulink url="https://github.com/romannurik/android-swipetodismiss">Android swipe-to-dismiss library</ulink>
		which
		Jake Wharton backported to earlier Android releases at
		<ulink url="https://github.com/JakeWharton/SwipeToDismissNOA">SwipeToDismissNOA</ulink>.
