== Tutorial: How to display two items in a ListView
	
		You can use the
		`SimpleAdapter`
		class to show the data of two elements. This class expects a Array of
		Strings (
		`from`
		data) in which the fields of the input data are defined. It also
		requires a Array of ints which defines the IDs of the widgets in the
		layout for the row to which these fields are mapped.
	
	The actual data is then a list of Maps. The Map defines for each
		field in the from data a value.
	
	 The following shows an example which reuses an predefined layout
		from Android for the row.
