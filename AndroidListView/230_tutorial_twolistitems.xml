		You can use the
		<code>SimpleAdapter</code>
		class to show the data of two elements. This class expects a Array of
		Strings (
		<code>from</code>
		data) in which the fields of the input data are defined. It also
		requires a Array of ints which defines the IDs of the widgets in the
		layout for the row to which these fields are mapped.
	</para>
	<para>The actual data is then a list of Maps. The Map defines for each
		field in the from data a value.
	</para>
	<para> The following shows an example which reuses an predefined layout
		from Android for the row.
