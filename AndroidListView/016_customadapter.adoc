		<title>Developing a custom adapter
		
			The
			`ArrayAdapter`
			is limited as it supports only the mapping of
			`toString()`
			to one view in the row layout.
			To control the data assignment and to
			support
			several views, you
			have to
			create your
			custom adapter
			implementation.
		
		
			For this you would extend an
			existing adapter
			implementation or
			subclass the
			`BaseAdapter`
			class directly.
		

		TIP:
			
				Frequently you extend
				`ArrayAdapter`
				to write a custom adapter, as this is simpler than extending
				`BaseAdapter`
				directly.

		<title>Preparing a row for the list
		
			The adapter needs to create a layout for each row of the list.
			The
			`ListView`
			instance
			calls the
			`getView()`
			method on the adapter for each data element. In this method the
			adapter creates the row
			layout and maps the data to the views in the
			layout.
		

		
			This root of the layout is typically a
			`ViewGroup`
			(layout manager)
			and contains several other
			views
			, e.g., an
			`ImageView`
			and a
			`TextView`
			. The following graphic shows a list with different layouts for odd
			and even rows.
		

		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/adapter10.png" scale="60" />
				
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Adapter provides data and defines the layout per row</phrase>
				</textobject>
			
		

		
			Within the
			`getView()`
			method you would inflate an XML based layout and then set
			the
			content
			of
			the individual views based on the Java object for this row.
			To
			inflate the XML layout file, you can use the
			`LayoutInflator`
			system
			service.
		

		<note>
			
				This layout inflator service can get accessed via the
				`getLayoutInflator()`
				method of the
				activity
				or via the
				`context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE)
				`
				method call.
			
		

		
			After the adapter inflated the layout, it searches for the relevant
			views in the layout and fills them with the data.
			The individual
			elements
			in the layout can be found via
			the
			`findViewById()`
			method call on the top level view.
		

	

	<section id="adapterown_example">
		<title>Example for a custom adapter
		
			The following code shows an implementation of a custom adapter. This
			adapter
			assumes that you have two png files (no.png and ok.png) in
			one of
			your
			<filename class="directory">res/drawable_
			folders. The coding inflates an XML layout file,
			finds the relevant
			views
			in the layout and sets their content based on the input data.

		<title>Updating the data model from the adapter

		
			The row can also contain
			_views_
			which interact with the underlying data model via the adapter. For
			example, you can
			have
			a
			`Checkbox`
			in your row layout and if the
			`Checkbox`
			is selected, the underlying data is changed.
