=== When should you offer an undo action?
		
			It is good practice to allow the user to undo critical actions.
			Such a critical action is, for example, the deletion of list items.
		
		
			A proven
			pattern to handle this undo option is to offer
			a
			selection
			at the end of the
			screen. This selection vanishes after a
			predefined
			time or once
			the user continues to interact with the
			application.
		
		
			For example, the
			Gmail application implements such a
			behavior.

=== Example
		
			The following description contains an example for implementing
			an undo action. It uses an animation to phase out the
			undo button
			automatically out after a while.
		
		
			For this example create a new project called
			_com.vogella.android.userinterface.undo_
			based on the
			_BlankTemplate_
			template.
		

		
			Create the following layout for your
			_activity_
			. It uses a
			`FrameLayout`
			to show two different parts of the user interface. The button bar is
			initially hidden. The button uses a drawable. Either add such a
			drawable
			to your project or remove the reference.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/undo/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
		
			Change your
			_activity_
			so that it is similar to the following code. The project
			wizard generated an `ActionBar` entry. This entry is
			used in the following code. If in doubt, create your own `ActionBar`
			entry.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/undo/MainActivity.java[]
----
		

		
			If you select the entry in the
			_ActionBar_,
			the button bar becomes visible for 5 seconds.
