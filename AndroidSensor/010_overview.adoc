== Android Sensors

=== SensorManager

Android Sensors supports several sensors via the
`SensorManager`,
for
example the accelerometer. Unfortunately, you cannot test the
accelerometer on the Android emulator.

You can access a
`SensorManager`
via
`getSystemService(SENSOR_SERVICE)`.
The
`Sensor`
class defines several constants for accessing the different sensors.

* Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE
* Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD
* Sensor.TYPE_ORIENTATION
* Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER

You can access the sensor via the
`sensorManager.getDefaultSensor()`
method, which takes the sensor type and the delay
defined as constants on
`SensorManager` as parameters.

=== Sensor listener

Once you acquired a sensor, you
can register a
`SensorEventListener`
object
on it. This listener will get informed, if the sensor data
changes.

To
avoid the unnecessary usage of battery power,
you can register your
listener in
the
`onResume()`
method and de-register it in
the
`onPause()`
method.
