		<title>Purpose of data backup</title>
		<para>The backup service of Android allows you to copy your persistent
			application data to a remote cloud storage. This allows you to
			restore the application data and settings in case the
			user switches
			Android devices, re-installs the application or
			performs a factory
			reset.
		</para>
		<para>Data backup is not required to be available
			on all Android
			devices and the actual cloud storage might be customized by the
			device
			manufacturer. Therefore the Android team guarantees no safety
			for the
			stored data.
		</para>
		<para>
			If the service is not
			available on your device, the backup
			service is not called, hence
			it is still
			save
			to implement this service
			and run it on any device.
		</para>
		<para>
			To use the backup service you have to register your application
			package for it
			at the following URL:
			<ulink url="https://developer.android.com/google/backup/signup.html">Backup service registration</ulink>
			. This webpage allows you to get a backup key for a application
			package.

		<para>
			For saving and restoring your data you extend the
			<code>BackupAgent</code>
			class.
		</para>
		<para>
			The simplest way to implement your backup is to use
			<code>SharedPreferencesBackupHelper</code>
			for shared preferences and
			<code>FileBackupHelper</code>
			to backup
			files from the internal storage system. Both helper classes
			save and restore automatically the registered files.
		</para>

			For a more complex backup you can directly implement the BackupAgent
			and its save and restore methods.
