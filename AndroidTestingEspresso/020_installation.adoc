=== Configuration in your project

To use Espresso for your tests, add the following dependency to the Gradle build file of your app.

[source,java]
----
include::res/install/build.gradle[]
----

	
You must also specify the `AndroidJUnitRunner` as value for the <parameter>testInstrumentationRunner</parameter> parameter in the build.gradle file of your app. 
The following listing is an example for that.

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/install/androidjunitrunner.java[]
----	

It is also recommended to turn of the animation on the Android device which is used for testing. 

=== Location of your tests
		
Espresso tests must be located by default in the <filename>app/src/androidTest</filename> folder.
