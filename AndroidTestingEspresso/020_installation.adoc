=== Configuration in your project

To use Espresso for your tests, add the following dependency to the Gradle build file of your app.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/install/build.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
You must also specify the `AndroidJUnitRunner` as value for the <parameter>testInstrumentationRunner</parameter> parameter in the build.gradle file of your app. 
The following listing is an example for that.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/install/androidjunitrunner.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

It is also recommended to turn of the animation on the Android device which is used for testing.
