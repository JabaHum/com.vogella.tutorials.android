== Using Espresso to test asynchronous code
	
Testing asynchronous without framework support is challenging. 
The typical approach before Espresso was to wait for a predefined time. 
Or to use an instance of the `CountDownLatch` class in your test code and signal from the asynchronous processing that the processing was done. 
Espresso makes this much easier as it monitors automatically the thread pool behind the `AsynchronousTask`.
It also monitors the event queue of the user interfacevand continues only with its test once no task is running.
	
If you use different resources, like an IntentService you need to implement an `IdlingResource`. 
This implementation must monitor this resource and register this monitor with the Espresso framework.
