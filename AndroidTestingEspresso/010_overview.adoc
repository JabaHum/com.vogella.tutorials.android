== The Espresso test framework
	
_Espresso_ is a testing framework for Android to make it easy to write reliable user interface tests for a single application.
Google released the Espresso framework in Oct. 2013. 
Since its 2.0 release Espresso is part of the Android Support Repository.
	
Espresso automatically synchronizes your test actions with the user interface of your application. 
The framework also ensures that your activity is started before the tests run.
It also let the test wait until all observed background activities have finished.
	
	
Espresso has basically three components:

* _ViewMatchers_ - allows to find view in the current view hierarchy
* _ViewActions_ - allows to perform actions on the views
* _ViewAssertions_ - allows to assert state of a view

The case construct for Espresso tests is the following:

.Base Espresso Test
[source,java]
----
onView(ViewMatcher)       #<1>
 .perform(ViewAction)     #<2>
   .check(ViewAssertion); #<3>
----

<1> - Finds the view
<2> - Performs an action on the view
<3> - Validates a assertioin 
	
	
The following code demonstrates the usage of the Espresso test framework.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/espresso/demo.java[]
----
	
If Espresso does not find a view via the `ViewMatcher`, it includes the whole view hierarchy into the error message. 
That is useful for analyzing the problem.

== Running Espresso tests


[[espresso_runningespressotests_androidstudio]]
=== Start an Espresso test via Android Studio
        
Ensure to select `Android Instrumentation Tests` in your_Build Variant_ view and right-click on your test and select_Run_.

[[espresso_runningespressotests_gradle]]
=== Start an Espresso test via Gradle
        

Use the `connectedCheck` task in Gradle to run the test directly via Gradle.
