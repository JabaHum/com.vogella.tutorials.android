		<title>What is the Android Native Development Kit (NDK)</title>
		<para>The Android NDK allows you to use native code in your Android
			application. This can be useful in case you have a
			complex algorithm
			which you need to optimize or in case you have a lot of native C code
			already which you want to port
			to Android.
		</para>
		<para>The native code is called via the Java Native Interface (JNI).
			JNI is a Java standard for accessing native code
			and the
			NDK provides
			the infrastructure to use JNI in Android applications.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				JNI
				adds some overhead. So the overall performance might be
				better if you use
				only Java.
			</para>
