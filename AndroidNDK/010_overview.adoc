== Developing native code with the Android Gradle plugin

=== What is the Android Native Development Kit (NDK)
The Android NDK allows you to use native code in your Android
application. This can be useful in case you have a
complex algorithm
which you need to optimize or in case you have a lot of native C code
already which you want to port
to Android.

The native code is called via the Java Native Interface (JNI).
JNI is a Java standard for accessing native code
and the
NDK provides
the infrastructure to use JNI in Android applications.

NOTE: JNI adds some overhead. 
So the overall performance might be better if you use only Java.


=== Usage of the Android NDK

Android Studio and the Android Gradle plugin support the creation of native code.
