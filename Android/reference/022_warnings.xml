		<title>Warning messages

		
			The Android development tools show warnings in certain cases.
			This is most notable in case you use
			hard-coded
			strings in layout
			files. This is
			a valid warning, for real
			applications
			you should use
			resource files.
			But to
			simplify the
			creation of the
			example projects, we
			use
			Strings
			directly.
		
		<note>
			For simplification of the exercise description, certain steps
				are not described, e.g. the extraction of the Strings. Please ignore
				these warnings or perform the necessary steps to avoid them in
				addition to the exercise description.

		<title>Screenshots and description

		Google is actively developing the tooling for Android
			development. Therefore screenshots or certain
			descriptions in
			this
			$book may
			differ from the latest released version of the tooling.
		
		
			I hope that you are able
			to adjust the description to the latest
			tooling in case this happens.
