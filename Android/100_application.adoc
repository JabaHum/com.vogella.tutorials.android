		<title>Android application
		
			An
			_Android application_
			is a single installable unit which can be started and used
			independently of other Android applications.
		
		
			An Android application consists of
			Android
			components, Java source
			and
			resource files.
		
		
			Android application components can connect to
			components of other
			Android applications based on a task description
			represented by an
			`Intent`
			object.
			This way
			they can create
			cross-application
			tasks. The integration of these
			components can be done in a way that
			the Android application can still
			work flawless, even if the additional
			components are not installed or
			if different
			components perform the
			same task.

		<title>Application
		
			An Android application can have one
			`Application`
			class which is
			instantiated as soon as the application starts and
			it is the last
			component which is stopped during
			application shutdown.
		
		If not explicitly defined, Android creates a default application object for your application.

	<section id="components_activity">
		<title>Activity
		
			An
			_activity_
			is the visual representation of an Android
			application.
			An
			Android
			application
			can
			have
			several
			activities.
		
		
			Activities
			use
			<xref linkend="view_class" />
			,
			<xref linkend="layoutmanager_overview" />
			and
			fragments
			to create the user interface and to interact with the user. Both
			elements are
			described in the
			next
			sections.

	<section id="components_broadcastreceiver">
		<title>BroadcastReceiver
		
			A
			_broadcast receiver_
			(receiver)
			can be registered to
			listen to system messages and
			intents. A
			receiver
			gets notified by the Android system if
			the specified event
			occurs.
		
		
			For example, you can register a
			receiver
			for the event that the
			Android system finished the boot
			process. Or you
			can
			register for
			the
			event that the state of the phone changes, e.g.,
			someone is
			calling.

	<section id="components_services">
		<title>Service
		
			A
			_service_
			performs tasks without providing an user interface.
			They can
			communicate
			with other Android components, for example,
			via
			broadcast
			receivers and
			notify
			the
			user via the
			notification
			framework in
			Android.
		
	</section>
	<section id="components_contentprovider">
		<title>ContentProvider
		
			A
			_content provider_
			(provider)
			defines a structured interface to application data. A
			provider can be used for accessing data within one
			application, but
			can also be used to
			share data with other
			applications.
		
		
			Android
			contains an SQLite
			database which is frequently used in
			conjunction
			with a
			content provider. The SQLite
			database would store
			the data, which would be accessed
			via the provider.
		
	</section>



	<section id="overview_context">
		<title>Context
		
			Instances of the class
			`android.content.Context`
			provide the connection to
			the
			Android system which executes theapplication
			application. It also gives access to the
			resources of
			the project and
			the global information about the application environment.

		
		

			For example,
			you can check
			the size of the current device
			display
			via the
			`Context`
			.
		
		
			The
			`Context`
			class
			also
			provides access to Android
			_services_
			, e.g., the alarm manager to trigger time based events.
		
		
			Activities
			and
			services
			extend the
			`Context`
			class. Therefore, they can be directly used to access the
			`Context`
			.
