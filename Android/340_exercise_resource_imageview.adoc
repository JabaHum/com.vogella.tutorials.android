		<title>Add images to your application
		
			In this exercise you continue to use the application you created in
			<xref linkend="androidstudio_starter" />
			.
		

		
			Create two new images to your project called
			_ic_tethering_
			and
			_ic_offline_
			. The creation process is described in
			<xref linkend="androidstudio_createimage" />
			.

		<title>Add views to your project
		
			Open your
			layout file and add a new
			`Button`
			and an
			`ImageView`
			to it.

		<title>Assign image to your image view

		
			Assign the ic_offline file to your
			`ImageView`
			, via your layout file as demonstrated in the following XML
			snippet.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="./examples/exercise_resourceloading/assignimage.xml" />
			</programlisting>

	<section id="exercise_resources4">
		<title>Replace images via button click
		
			If the button is clicked, use the
			`findViewById()`
			to search for the
			`ImageView`
			.
			Use its
			`setImageResource()`
			method
			to assign the png file (which is represented at runtime via a
			`Drawable`
			object)
			to your
			`ImageView`
			.
			The parameter of the
			`setImageResource()`
			method is the
			`R`
			reference to your file, e.g.,
			`R.drawable.your_png_file`
			.
