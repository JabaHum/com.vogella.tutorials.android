			Android currently has several versions of the library, the v4,
			v7
			and v13 version which are valid as of the
			respective API level of
			Android. For example, the support library v7 works as of Android
			devices with version API 7.
			Higher versions of the support library
			require also the lower versions to work. For example, support
			library v7
			requires the v4 library.
