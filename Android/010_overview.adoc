		<title>The Android operating system
		
			_Android_
			is an operating system based on the Linux kernel. The
			project
			responsible for developing the Android system is called
			the
			_Android Open Source Project_
			(AOSP)
			and is lead
			by Google.
		
		
			The Android system supports background processing, provides a
			rich
			user
			interface library, supports 2-D and 3-D
			graphics using the
			OpenGL-ES (short OpenGL)
			standard and grants access to the file system
			as well as an
			embedded
			SQLite
			database.
		
		
			An Android application typically consists of different visual
			and non visual
			components and
			can
			reuse components of
			other
			applications.

			The Android system is a full software stack, which is typically
			divided into the four areas as depicted in the
			following graphic.

					<phrase>Android software layers</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		The levels can be described as:
		
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Applications - The Android Open Source Project contains
						several default application, like the Browser, Camera,
						Gallery,
						Music, Phone and more.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Application framework - An API which allows high-level
						interactions with the Android system from Android
						applications.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Libraries and runtime - The libraries for many common
						functions
						(e.g.: graphic rendering, data storage, web
						browsing,
						etc.) of the
						Application Framework and the Dalvik runtime, as well
						as the core
						Java libraries for running
						Android applications.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Linux kernel - Communication layer for the underlying
						hardware.
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		

		The Linux kernel, the libraries and
			the
			runtime are encapsulated
			by the application framework. The Android
			application developer
			typically works with the two layers on top
			to
			create
			new Android
			applications.

		<title>Google Play
		
			Google offers the
			_Google Play_
			service, a marketplace in which programmers can
			offer their Android
			applications to
			Android users. Customers use the
			_Google Play_
			application
			which allows them to buy and install
			applications from the
			Google
			Play service.
		
		Google Play also offers an update service. If a programmer
			uploads a new version of his application to Google
			Play, this service
			notifies existing users that an update is available and allows them
			to
			install the update.
		
		
			Google Play provides access to services and libraries for
			Android
			application
			programmers, too. For example, it
			provides a
			service to
			use and
			display
			Google Maps and another to synchronize the
			application
			state between different
			Android installations. Providing
			these
			services via Google Play has the advantage that they are
			available
			for older
			Android releases and can be updated by Google
			without the
			need for an update of the Android release on the phone.

		<title>How to develop Android applications
		Android applications are primarily written in the Java
			programming
			language.
		
		 During development the developer creates the Android specific
			configuration files and writes the application
			logic in the Java
			programming language.
		

		
			The Android development tooling converts these
			application
			files,
			transparently
			to
			the user, into an Android
			application.
			When
			developers trigger the deployment in their IDE,
			the whole
			Android
			application is
			compiled, packaged,
			deployed and started.
