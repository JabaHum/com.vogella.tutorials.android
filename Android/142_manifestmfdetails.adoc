	<title>More details of the Android manifest 

	<section id="manifestdetails_package">
		<title>Version and package
		
			The
			`package`
			attribute defines the base package for the
			Java objects referred to in
			this file. If a Java object lies within a
			different
			package, it must
			be declared with the full qualified package name.
		
		
			Google Play
			requires that every Android application uses its
			own
			unique package name.
			Therefore
			it is a good habit to
			use
			your
			reverse
			domain
			name here. This
			will
			avoid
			collisions with other
			Android
			applications.
		
		
			`android:versionName`
			and
			`android:versionCode`
			specify the
			version of your application.
			`versionName`
			is what the user sees and
			can be any string.
		
		
			`versionCode`
			must be an integer. The Android
			Market determines
			whether it should
			perform an update of the applications for the
			existing
			installation
			based on that
			`versionCode`
			.
			You
			typically
			start
			with "1" and
			increase this value by
			one if
			you
			roll-out
			a
			new
			version
			of your
			application.

	<section id="manifestdetails_components">
		<title>Application and components
		
			The
			`<![CDATA[ <application> ]]>`
			section allows to define metadata for your application and optionally
			define an explicit application class. It is also
			a container for
			declaring your Android components.
		
		
			The
			`<![CDATA[ <activity> ]]>`
			tag
			defines an
			activity component. The
			`name`
			attribute points to class, which (if not fully qualified) is
			relative
			to the package defined in the
			`package`
			attribute.
		
		
			The
			_intent filter_
			part in the Android manifest file, tells the Android runtime that
			this activity should be registered as a possible
			entry point into the
			application and made available in the launcher of the Android system.

			The action defines that it (
			`android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"
			`
			) can be started and the
			`<![CDATA[ category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"]]>`
			parameter tells the Android system to add the activity to the
			launcher.
		
		
			The
			`<![CDATA[ @string/app_name]]>
			`
			value refers to resource files which contain
			the actual value of the
			application name. The usage of a resource file
			makes it easy to
			provide
			different
			resources
			(e.g., strings, colors,
			icons) for different
			devices
			and makes it easy
			to
			translate
			applications.
		
		
			Similar to the
			`<![CDATA[ <activity> ]]>`
			tag, you can use the service, receiver and provider to declare other
			Android components.

	<section id="manifestdetails_min">
		<title>Minimum and target SDK
		
			The
			`uses-sdk`
			section in the manifest allows you to specify the
			`minSdkVersion`
			and
			`targetSdkVersion`
			version of your application.

			<table frame='all'>
				<title>Minimum and target version
				<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
					<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*" />
					<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="3*" />
					<thead>
						<row>
							<entry>Value</entry>
							<entry>Description</entry>
						</row>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>minSdkVersion</entry>
							<entry>Define the minimum version of Android your application
								works on. This attribute is used as a filter in
								Google Play,
								i.e., a user cannot install your application on a device with a
								lower API level than specified in
								this attribute.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>targetSdkVersion</entry>
							<entry>Specifies the version on which you tested and developed.
								If it is not equal to the API version of the
								Android device,
								the Android
								system might apply forward- or backward-compatibility
								changes. It is good practice to
								always set this to the
								latest Android API version to take advantages of changes in the
								latest Android
								improvements.
							</entry>
						</row>
					</tbody>
				</tgroup>

	<section id="manifestdetails_permissions">
		<title>Permissions
		
			The Android manifest file must also contain the
			required
			permissions for
			the
			application.
			For
			example, if
			the
			application requires
			network access,
			it
			must be
			specified
			here.
		
		
			Your application can declare permissions with the
			`<![CDATA[ <permission> ]]>`
			tag and declare that it required a permision with the
			`<![CDATA[ <uses-permission> ]]>`
			tag.
		
		Certain permissions, like network access, are granted automatically on Android 6.0 or higher systems. Other
			permissions must be confirmed by the users to become active.

	<section id="manifestdetails_usesconfiguration">
		<title>Required device configuration
		
			The
			`uses-configuration`
			section in the manifest allows you to specify required input methods
			for your device. For example, the following
			snippet would
			require that
			the device has a hardware keyboard.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/manifest/useconfiguration.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The
			`uses-feature`
			section allows you to specify the required hardware configuration
			for your
			device. For example, the following snippet
			would
			require that
			the
			device
			has a camera.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/manifest/usefeature.xml" />
			</programlisting>

	<section id="manifestdetails_installation">
		<title>Installation location
		
			Via the
			`installLocation`
			attribute of your application you can specify if your application can
			be installed on the external storage of the
			device. Use
			`auto`
			or
			`preferExternal`
			to permit this.
		
		
			In reality this option is rarely used, as an application
			installed on the external storage is stopped once the
			device is
			connected to a computer and mounted as USB storage.
