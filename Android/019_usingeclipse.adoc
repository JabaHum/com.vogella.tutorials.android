	<title>Using Eclipse for Android development
	
		The Google development team focus their future development on Android Studio, so this is currently the best
		development environment for Android applications. 
		At the moment the ADT tooling uses a special Eclipse build system and
		not
		the new Gradle build system.
		This can create
		inconsistencies in
		your
		build. If you want the Gradle support for Eclipse please go to
		<ulink url="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81451">Support Gradle builds for Eclipse bug report</ulink>
		and press the star sign.

		The other blocking issue for the usage of Eclipse for future Android development is the missing support for AAR files.
		Please also vote on
		<ulink url="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=59183">Allow Eclipse ADT plugin to work with .AAR files</ulink>
