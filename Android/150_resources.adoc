			Android allows you to create static resources like images and XML configuration files. This allows you to keep
			these resources separate
			from the source code of your Android application.
		
		
			Resource files must be
			placed
			in the
			<filename class="directory">/res_
			directory of your application in a predefined sub-folder. The specific sub-folder depends
			on type of resource which is
			stored. You
			can
			also append additional
			qualifiers to the folder
			name to
			indicate
			that
			the related resources
			should be used
			for
			special
			configurations. This are called
			_resource qualifiers_
			.
			For
			example, you can
			specify
			that layout file is only
			valid for
			a
			certain
			screen
			size.

		


		
			The
			following table gives
			an overview of the supported resources
			and
			their
			standard folder
			prefixes.

		<title>Example: Defining strings, string arrays, colors and dimensions
		
			The following listing is an example for file called
			_values.xml_
			in the
			_/res/values_
			which defines a few String constants, a String array, a color and a
			dimension.

	<section id="resources_ids">
		<title>Resource files and R.java

		
			Every relevant resource in the
			<filename class="directory">res_
			folder, gets an ID assigned by the Android build system.
			Android generates
			<filename class="directory">gen_
			a
			_R.java_
			file
			which ccontains these generated
			values. These
			references are static
			integer
			values.
		

		
			If you
			add a new
			resource file, the corresponding
			reference is
			automatically
			created in a
			_R.java_
			file.
			Manual changes in the
			_R.java_
			file are not
			necessary and will be overwritten
			by the
			tooling.
			The Android
			system
			provides
			methods to access the
			corresponding
			resource files
			via these IDs.
		
		
			For
			example, to
			access a
			String with the
			`R.string.yourString`
			ID in your source code,
			you would use the
			`getString(R.string.yourString)`
			method defined on the
			`Context`
			class.

	<section id="layoutresource_activities">
		<title>Layout files
		
			Android activities define their user interface with
			views
			(widgets) and
			fragments.
			This user interface
			can be
			defined via
			XML
			layout
			resource
			files in the
			<filename class="filename">/res/layout_
			folder or via Java code. You
			can
			also
			mix
			both approaches.
		
		
			Defining layouts via
			XML layout files
			is the
			preferred way.
			This
			separates the programming logic
			from the layout
			definition. It
			also
			allows the definition of different layouts
			for different
			devices.
		

		
			A layout resource file is referred to as
			_layout_
			. A layout
			specifies the
			`ViewGroups`
			,
			`Views`
			,
			their
			relationship and
			their attributes via an XML representation.
		
		The following code is an example for a simple layout file.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/layout/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			A layout is assigned to an activity via the
			`setContentView()`
			method calls, as demonstrated in the following example code.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/layout/MainActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>

	<section id="layoutresource_performance">
		<title>Performance considerations with layouts
		Calculating the layout and drawing the views is a resource
			intensive operation. You
			should use the simplest layout
			possible to
			achieve good performance.
			For example, you should
			avoid nesting
			layout
			managers
			too deeply or avoid using
			complex layout managers in case a
			simple layout manager is sufficient.

		<title>Good practices for resources IDs
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Resource ID's
			</primary>
			<secondary>Good practices
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			If a
			view
			needs to be
			accessed via Java or XML code, you have
			to give the view
			a
			unique ID
			via the
			`android:id`
			attribute. To assign a new
			ID to a view
			use the
			`android:id`
			attribute of the corresponding element in the layout file.

		

		
			The Android SDK uses the
			_camelCase_
			notation
			for most of its IDs, e.g.,
			`buttonRefresh`
			. It is good practice to follow this approach.
		




		
			The
			following shows an example in which a button
			gets the
			`button1`
			ID assigned via the
			`android:id="@+id/button1"`
			parameter.
			By conversion this statement
			creates a new ID if necessary in the
			`R.java`
			file and assigns the defined ID
			to the corresponding
			view.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/id.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			It is good practice to
			define IDs in one central configuration file. This is typically called
			_ids.xml_
			and placed
			in the
			<filename class="directory">/res/values_
			folder. This allows you to use the predefined ID in your layout file. If you want to define the id in a separate
			file, you first
			need to remove the @+id entries in your layout
			files, otherwise you
			get an error messages that these
			files have already been created. The following listing shows
			an example for such
			a file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/ids/ids.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/ids/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		<note>
			While the above is good practice for real projects, the
				tutorials of this $book avoid the usage of a separate id
				file as
				this setup is time consuming.

		<title>System resources
		
			Android also provides resources. These are called
			_system resources_
			. System resources are distinguished from local resources by the
			`android`
			namespace prefix. For example,
			`android.R.string.cancel`
			defines the platform string for a cancel operation.
