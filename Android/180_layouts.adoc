== Layout manager and ViewGroups

[[layoutmanager_overview]]
=== Using a layout manager
		
A layout manager is responsible for layouting itself and its child `Views`
It is a subclass of `ViewGroup`.

Android supports different default layout managers.
		
The most relevant layout managers in Android are:

* `ConstraintLayout - provided by an extra library`
* `LinearLayout`
* `FrameLayout`
* `RelativeLayout`
* `GridLayout`


[[layoutmanager_attributes]]
=== Layout attributes
		
All layout manager can be configured via attributes. 
Children can also define attributes which may be evaluated by their parent layout.
		
Children can specify their desired width and height via the following attributes.

* `android:layout_width` - Defines the width of the widget.
* `android:layout_height` - Defines the height of the widget.
		
		
Views can define their size. 
This can be done in units of measurement or via pre-defined layout values.
For example, as <parameter>100dp</parameter>. 
		
The <parameter>match_parent</parameter> value tells the application to maximize the widget in its parent. 
The <parameter>wrap_content</parameter> value tells the layout to allocate the minimum amount so that the widget is rendered correctly. 
The effect of these elements is demonstrated in the following graphics.

[[layoutmanager_constraintlayout]]]
=== Constraint layout

Constraint layout is provided by an external library.
It allows you to use a flat view hierarchy and has great performance.
Also the design tools support constraint layout very well.
New projects should prefer the usage of constraint layout.


[[layoutmanager_framelayout]]]
=== FrameLayout
		
`FrameLayout` is a layout manager which draws all child elements on top of each other. 
This allows to create nice visual effects.
		
The following screenshot shows the Gmail application which uses `FrameLayout` to display several button on top of another layout.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/undobutton02.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>FrameLayout</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

[[layoutmanager_linearlayout]]
=== LinearLayout
		
`LinearLayout` puts all its child elements into a single column or row depending on the `android:orientation` attribute. 
Possible values for this attribute are
			<parameter>horizontal</parameter>
			and
			<parameter>vertical</parameter>
			while
			<parameter>horizontal</parameter>
			is the default value.
		

		If horizontal is used, the child elements are layouted as
			indicated by the following picture.
		

		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/linearlayout20.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase></phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		Vertical would result in a layout as depicted in the following
			picture.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/linearlayout10.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase></phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			`LinearLayout`
			can be nested to achieve more complex layouts.
		
		
			`LinearLayout`
			supports assigning a weight to individual children via the
			<parameter>android:layout_weight</parameter>
			layout parameter. This value specifies how much of the extra space in
			the layout is allocated to the corresponding
			view. If, for example, you have two widgets and the first one defines a
			<parameter>layout_weight</parameter>
			of 1 and the second of 2, the first will get 1/3 of the available
			space and the other one 2/3. You can also set the
			<parameter>layout_width</parameter>
			to
			zero to always have a certain ratio.

[[layoutmanager_relativelayout]]
=== RelativeLayout
		
			`RelativeLayout`
			allows positioning the widget relative to each other. This can be
			used for
			complex layouts. RelativeLayout is a complex
			layout manager and should only be
			used if such a complex layout is required, as it performs a resource
			intensive
			calculation
			to layout its children.
		
		
			A simple
			usage for
			`RelativeLayout`
			is if you want to center a single component. Just add one component
			to the
			`RelativeLayout`
			and set the
			`android:layout_centerInParent`
			attribute to true.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/centerlayout.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

[[gridlayout_overview]]
=== GridLayout
		
			`GridLayout`
			was introduced with Android 4.0. This layout allows you to organize a
			view into a Grid. GridLayout
			separates its
			drawing area into: rows,
			columns, and cells.
		
		
			You can specify how many columns you want to define for each
			`View`
			,
			in which row and column it should be placed as well as how many
			columns and
			rows it should use. If not specified,
			`GridLayout`
			uses defaults, e.g., one column, one row and the position of
			a view
			depends on the order of the declaration.
		

		
			The following layout file defines a layout using
			`GridLayout`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/gridlayout/main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		This creates a user interface similar to the following
			screenshot.


		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/gridlayout.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>GridLayout Activity result</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>

[[gridlayout_scrollview]]
=== ScrollView
		
The `ScrollView` or the `HorizontalScrollView` class is not a layout manager.
It is useful to make views available, even if they do not fit onto the screen.
A scroll view can contain one view, e.g., a layout manager containing more views.
If the child view is too large, scroll view allows scrolling the content.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/layout_scrollview10.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Scroll view</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		
			The following code shows an example layout file which uses a
			`ScrollView`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/scrollview/simple.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			The
			<parameter>android:fillViewport="true"</parameter>
			attribute ensures that the
			scrollview is set to the full screen even
			if the elements are smaller
			than one
			screen.
