		<title>Android SDK
		
			The
			_Android Software Development Kit_
			(Android SDK) contains the necessary tools to create, compile
			and
			package
			Android applications. Most of these tools are
			command line
			based. The
			primary way to develop
			Android applications is based on the
			Java
			programming
			language.

		<title>Android debug bridge (adb)
		
			The Android SDK contains the
			_
				Android debug bridge
			_
			(adb), which is a tool that allows you to connect to a virtual or
			real
			Android
			device, for the purpose of managing the
			device or
			debugging your
			application.

		<title>Gradle and the Android plug-in for Gradle
		The Android tooling uses Gradle as build system. The Android team provides a Gradle plug-in for build Android
			applications which is entered in the build.gradle file in the top root of the Android project. It typically looks
			like the following, please note that the version might be different in your case.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/build/build.gradle" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			You find the available versions of this plug-in under the following URL:

		<title>Android Developer Tools and Android Studio
		
			Google provides an IDE called
			_Android Studio_
			as the preferred development environment for creating Android applications. This IDE is based on the
			IntelliJ
			IDE.
		


		The Android tools provide specialized editors
			for Android specific
			files. Most of Android's configuration files
			are
			based
			on XML. In
			this
			case
			these
			editors allow you to switch
			between the XML
			representation of
			the
			file and
			a structured
			user
			interface for entering
			the data.
		
		
			This description uses Android Studio as IDE.

		<title>Android RunTime (ART)
		
			Android 5.0 uses the
			_Android RunTime_
			(ART) as
			runtime for all Android applications.
		

		
			ART uses
			_Ahead Of Time_
			compilation. During the deployment process of an application on an
			Android
			device, the application code is translated
			into machine code.
			This
			results in approx. 30% larger compile code, but allows faster
			execution from the beginning of
			the application.
		
		This also saves battery life, as the compilation is only done
			once, during the first start of the application.
		
		
			The
			`dex2oat`
			tool takes the .dex file created by the Android tool change and
			compiles that into an Executable and Linkable Format
			(ELF file).
			This
			file contains the
			dex code, compiled native code and
			meta-data.
			Keeping
			the .dex code
			allows that existing
			tools still
			work.
		
		The garbage collection in ART has been optimized to reduce times
			in which the application freezes.

		<title>Conversion process from source code to Android application
		
			The Java source files are converted to Java
			class files by
			the
			Java
			compiler.
		
		
			The Android SDK contains a tool called
			_dx_
			which
			converts Java
			class
			files
			into a
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			(Dalvik Executable)
			file. All class files of the application are
			placed in this
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			file. During this conversion process
			redundant
			information in the class
			files are optimized in the
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			file.
		
		
			For example, if the same
			`String`
			is found in different class
			files,
			the
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			file
			contains only one reference of this
			`String`
			.
		
		
			These
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			files are therefore
			much smaller in size
			than the
			corresponding
			class
			files.
		
		
			The
			<filename>.dex</filename>
			file and the resources of an Android project, e.g., the
			images and
			XML
			files, are packed into an
			<filename>.apk</filename>
			(Android Package)
			file. The program
			_aapt_
			(Android Asset Packaging Tool) performs this step.
		

		
			The resulting
			<filename>.apk</filename>
			file contains all necessary data to run the
			Android application and
			can be deployed to an Android device via the
			_adb_
			tool.

		<title>Using Java 8 in Android applications
		
			The latest Gradle plug-in supports the usage of Java 8, with some restrictions. As of Android Gingebread (API 9)
			and
			above you can use:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Lambda expressions
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					java.util.function
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		
			As of Android N you can use:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Default and static interface methods
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Repeatable annotations
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Streams
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Reflection APIs
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		To enable Java 8 in your project use the following settings. Important is the jackOptions part and the compileOptions.
