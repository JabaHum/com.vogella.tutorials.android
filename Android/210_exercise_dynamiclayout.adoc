== Exercise: Influence view layout at runtime
=== Target of this exercise

In this exercise you add radio buttons the layout of the application you created in
<<androidstudio_starter>>. 
Depending
on the
user selection the radio button arrangement changes from
horizontal to
vertical.

=== Add radio group and radio buttons to your layout

Open your
layout file
and add a radio group with two radio buttons
to
your
layout.


Assign them based on the following table.


<table frame='all'>
<title>ID Assignment
<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*"/>
<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="2*"/>
<thead>
<row>
<entry>ID</entry>
<entry>View</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>
<row>
<entry>
orientation
</entry>
<entry>Radio Group</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>horizontal</entry>
<entry>First radio button</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>vertical</entry>
<entry>Second radio button</entry>
</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>


The resulting layout file
should be similar to
the
following
listing.
Note: Only the
`RadioGroup`
part is new.


[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/textlayout.txt[]
----


The resulting layout should look like the following screenshot.

=== Change radio group orientation dynamically

Change the
`onCreate()`
method in your
activity. Use the
`findViewById()`
method to find the
`RadioGroup`
in your layout.



Implement a listener on the radio group
which changes the
orientation of the radio buttons based on the
current
selection of the
buttons. Which button is selected, can be
identified by the ID
parameter.

[TIP]
====

`RadioGroup`
allows you to add a
`RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener`
from the
`android.widget.RadioGroup`
package
via the
`setOnCheckedChangeListener()`
method. This listener is notified if the selection of the
radio group
changes.

You can use the following code as template to implement the
listener.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/listener.txt[]
----

====

=== Validating
Run your application and select the different radio button.
Ensure that the
orientation of the buttons is changed
based on your
selection.
