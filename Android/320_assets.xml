		<title>Whats are assets?
		
			While the
			<filename class="directory">res</filename>
			directory
			contains structured values which
			are
			known to the
			Android
			platform, the
			<filename class="directory">assets</filename>
			directory
			can be used
			to
			store any kind
			of
			data.
		
		
			You can access files stored in this folder based on their path. The
			<filename class="directory">assets</filename>
			directory also allows you to have sub-folders.
		
		<note>
			
				You could also store unstructured data in the
				<filename class="directory">/res/raw</filename>
				folder, but it is considered good practice to use the
				<filename class="directory">assets</filename>
				directory for such data.

		<title>Accessing assets
		
			You access this
			data
			via the
			`AssetsManager`
			which you can access via the
			`getAssets()`
			method from an instance of the
			`Context`
			class.
		
		
			The
			`AssetsManager`
			class
			allows you to read a file in the
			<filename class="directory">assets</filename>
			folder as
			`InputStream`
			with the
			`open()`
			method. The following code shows an example for this.
