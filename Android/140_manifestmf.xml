		<title>Configuration of your Android application
		
			The components, settings and metadata of an Android application are described
			in the
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file. This file is known as the
			_manifest file_
			or the
			_manifest_
			.
		
		
			All
			activities,
			services
			and
			content provider
			components of the
			application
			must be statically declared in this
			file.
			Broadcast receiver
			can be defined statically in the manifest file or dynamically at
			runtime in the application. This
			file is read by the Android system during installation of
			the application. The Android system evaluates this configuration file
			and determines the capabilities of the application.
		
		The Gradle build system for building and packaging Android application can modify the manifest file. For
			example,
			the  application version is typically supplied by the Gradle build file.
