== Exercise: Use layouts and view interaction
=== Target of this exercise
		
In this exercise you learn how to interact between your user interface widgets using data binding.
You continue to use the application you created already in <<androidstudio_starter>>.
		

=== Create handler for the view interaction

Create the following class which is later assigned to your button.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutbutton/MainActivityHandlers.java[]
----

=== Activate the usage of data binding
		
Open your _app/build.gradle_ file and activate the usage of databinding. 
Ensure you pick the correct build file, it is the one with the `application` node in it.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutbutton/build.gradle[]
----
		

=== Adjust layout files to use data binding
		
Open the _activity_main.xml_ layout file in the _res/layout_ folder.
Investigate the XML layout in the visual editor as well in as the XML structure.
Remove all views, except the top level entry which is the layout manager.
Afterwards prepare you layout file for the usage of data binding. 
The result layout file should look similar to the following file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutbutton/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Add an `Plain Text` (EditText) and a `Button` to your layout.
Use the text (XML) editor to change the ID of the new `EditText` field to `main_input` . 
In the XML file this looks like `@+id/main_input`.
		
Change the button text to _Start_ via the `android:text`
property in your layout file.
Assign the `android:onClick` property of your `Button` to your handler via data binding.
		

After these changes your layout file should be similar to the following code.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutbutton/solution_activity_main.xml[]
----	
		
[NOTE]
====
You see some warning messages in the editor, e.g., because you used hard-codes strings.
We demonstrates later how to get rid of these warning messages.
====

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutbutton/solution_MainActivity.java[]
----	
Adjust your `MainActivity` code to activate data binding.
		

=== Validate your application
You can start your application in the emulator or use the layout review in your IDE. 
If you press the button, a small popup should be shown.
Ensure that the text from your EditText field is displayed.

		
The result should look similar to the following screenshot.
