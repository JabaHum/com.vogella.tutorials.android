		<title>Android perspective
		
			ADT adds the DDMS (Dalvik Device Monitoring Service)
			perspective to Eclipse
			for interacting with your Android
			(virtual) device and your
			Android
			application program. Select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Window</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Open Perspective</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>Other...</guisubmenu>
				<guisubmenu>DDMS</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			to open this perspective. It groups several
			Eclipse views
			which can
			also be used independently.
		
		
			On the left side it shows you the connected Android devices and
			the running processes on the device. The right side is a stack of
			views with different purposes. You can select processes and trigger
			actions from the toolbar, e.g., start a trace or stop the process.
