== Assets
=== Whats are assets?
		
While the _res_ directory
contains structured values which
are
known to the
Android
platform, the
_assets_
directory
can be used
to
store any kind
of
data.
		
		
You can access files stored in this folder based on their path. The
_assets_
directory also allows you to have sub-folders.

[NOTE]
====
You could also store unstructured data in the
_/res/raw_
folder, but it is considered good practice to use the
_assets_
directory for such data.

=== Accessing assets
		
You access this
data
via the
`AssetsManager`
which you can access via the
`getAssets()`
method from an instance of the
`Context`
class.
		
The
`AssetsManager`
class
allows you to read a file in the
_assets_
folder as
`InputStream`
with the
`open()`
method. The following code shows an example for this.
		
[source,java]
