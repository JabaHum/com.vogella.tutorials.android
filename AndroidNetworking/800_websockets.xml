	<para>
		Web Sockets are a standard based on HTTP for asynchronous
		message-based
		communication between a client and a server. To start a
		web socket communication, you create a HTTP GET request with a special
		HTTP headers. If the server accepts this request, the client and the
		server can send each other messages.
	</para>
	<para>Messages can be text or binary data and should be relatively
		small, as the web socket protocol is intended to be used with small
		payloads in the data.
	</para>
	<para>It is good practice to use JSON as data format for the messages.
