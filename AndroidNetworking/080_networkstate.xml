	<title>Check the network availability
	
		Obviously the network on an Android device is not always
		available. You
		can check the network is currently available via
		the
		following code.

	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/status/check.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		This requires the
		`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
		permission.
