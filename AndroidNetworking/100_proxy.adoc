== Proxy

This chapter is only relevant for you if you are testing with the
Android simulator behind a proxy.
You can set
the proxy via the
`Settings`
class. For example
you could add
the
following line to your
`onCreate`
method in your
_activity_
.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/proxy/setproxy.java[]
----	
	
To change the proxy settings you have to have the
`android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS`
permission
in your
_AndroidManifest.xml_ file.

TIP:It seems that DNS resolving does not work behind a proxy. Seehttp://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2764 - Bug 2764
