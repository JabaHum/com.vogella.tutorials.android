	<title>Proxy

	
		This chapter is only relevant for you if you are testing with the
		Android simulator behind a proxy.
		You can set
		the proxy via the
		`Settings`
		class. For example
		you could add
		the
		following line to your
		`onCreate`
		method in your
		_activity_
		.
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/proxy/setproxy.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		To change the proxy settings you have to have the
		`android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS`
		permission
		in your
		<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename> file.

		<tip>
			It seems that DNS resolving does not work behind a proxy. See
			http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2764[Bug 2764]
