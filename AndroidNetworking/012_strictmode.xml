	<title>Good practices for network access under Android
	
		Within an Android application you should avoid performing long
		running
		operations on the user interface thread. This includes file and
		network
		access.
	
	
		As of Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) the system is configured
		to crash with a
		`NetworkOnMainThreadException`
		exception, if network is accessed in the user interface thread.
	
	A typical setup for performing network access in a productive
		Android application is using a service. While it is possible to do
		network access from an activity or a fragment, using a service typical
		leads to a better overall design because you code in the activity
		becomes simpler.

			For testing you can allow network access in the main thread via the
			following snippet. at the beginning of your
			`onCreate()`
			method of your
			_activity_
			.
