		<title>Prepare project
		
			Create a new project called
			_com.vogella.android.lifecycle.activity_
			.
		
		Create the following class which is used to report lifecycle
			events via notifications.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/report/TracerActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			Create two activity which extend this one. The first activity
			should
			allow to start the second one via an
			`Intent`
			.
		


	
	<section id="exercise_lifecycle2">
		<title>Testing
		Start your application and trigger the second activity. Review
			the notifications and ensure you know why this order of things are
			happening.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/activity_lifecycle20.png"
						scale="40" />
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Notifications about the lifecycle</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		
			Press the Back button on the second activity. Validate that
			`onSaveInstanceState()`
			is not
			called. Explain why it is not called.
		
		
			Press the home button on the second activity. Validate that
			`onSaveInstanceState()`
			is called. Explain why it is called.
		
		
			Start the second activity. Switch the orientation of your
			emulator via
			the
			<keycombo>
				<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
				<keycap>F11</keycap>
			</keycombo>
			shortcut and see which life cycle methods of
			the activity are called.
			Is the first activity also re-created or
			only the second one?
		
		
			Activate the
			<guilabel>Don't keep activities</guilabel>
			setting in the
			_Developer Options_
			. Test again which methods are called.

		<title>Instance state
		
			Create a string array and add a spinner to your first
			activity using
			this array. The following lists the
			_strings.xml_
			and the layout file used by the first activity.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/report/strings.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/report/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		


		Ensure that the selection of the spinner is saved and restored
			between configuration changes or restarts of the activity by the
			Android system.
