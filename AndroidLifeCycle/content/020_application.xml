	<title>Application</title>
	<para>
		The application object is created whenever one of your Android
		components are started. It is started in a new process with a unique
		ID under a unique user. Even if you do not specify one in your
		<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
		file, the Android system creates a default object for you.
		This object
		provides the following main lifecycle methods:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>onCreate() - called before the first components of the
					application starts
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>onLowMemory() - called when the Android system requests that
					the application cleans up memory
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>onTrimMemory() - called when the Android system requests that
					the application cleans up memory. This message includes an
					indicator in which position the application is. For example the
					constant TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE indicates that the process is around
					the middle of
					the background LRU list; freeing memory can help the
					system keep
					other processes running later in the list for better
					overall
					performance.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>onTerminate() - only for testing, not called in production
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>onConfigurationChanged() - called whenever the configuration
					changes
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>The application object starts before any component and runs at
		least as long as another component of the application runs.
