	<title>Exercise: Multitouch
	
		In this exercise you create a view which support multitouch and
		allows
		you to track several fingers on your device. On the Android
		emulator
		you can only simulate singletouch with the mouse.
	
	
		Create
		an Android project called
		_com.vogella.android.multitouch_
		with the
		>activity
		called
		_MainActivity_
		.
	
	
		Create the following
		`MultitouchView`
		class.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/multi/MultitouchView.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Add this view to the layout of your activity.
	
	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/multi/activity_main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	Your generated activity can remain the same.

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/multi/MainActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	 If you run your application you will be able to draw on the
		screen with your fingers. Every device has an upper limit how many
		pointers are supported, test out how many simultaneous pointers your
		device supports. This application should look similar to the following
		screenshot.
