		<title>Draw via touch
		
			This exercise demonstrates the handling of (single) touch events
			within a custom
			view.
		
		

			Create an Android project called
			_com.vogella.android.touch.single_
			with the
			_activity_
			called
			_SingleTouchActivity_
			.
		
		
			Create the following
			`SingleTouchEventView`
			class which implements a View which supports single touch.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/single/SingleTouchEventView.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Add this view to your
			_activity_
			.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/single/SingleTouchActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 If you run your application you will be able to draw on the
			screen with your finger (or with the mouse in the emulator).
		
		 Change your coding so that you use a layout definition based on
			XML. Hint: to use your own view in an XML layout definition you have
			to
			use the full-qualified class name (class including package
			information).

			Add code to your drawing example so that the current position
			of a
			finger is marked via a circle. To draw a circle you can use the
			`addCircle(x, y, 50, Path.Direction.CW)`
			method call on a
			`Path`
			or use the canvas element directly.
		
		
			Make sure that only the current position is highlighted
			with a
			circle. The circle should appears as soon as the
			finger goes down and
			vanish once the finger goes up.
		
		 The result should look like the following. 

		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/drawing_result10.png" scale="30" />
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Activity showing the drawing View</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
