			Add code to your drawing example so that the current position
			of a
			finger is marked via a circle. To draw a circle you can use the
			<code>addCircle(x, y, 50, Path.Direction.CW)</code>
			method call on a
			<code>Path</code>
			or use the canvas element directly.
		</para>
		<para>
			Make sure that only the current position is highlighted
			with a
			circle. The circle should appears as soon as the
			finger goes down and
			vanish once the finger goes up.
