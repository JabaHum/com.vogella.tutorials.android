=== How not to do it

Activities and services can be terminated at any point in time by the Android system to free up resources.
Therefore the following code snippet would be wrong.

=== Options for scheduling

The Android system currently has two main means to schedule task, the `AlarmManager` and the `JobScheduler` API.
Modern Android apps should use the `JobScheduler` API.  
Apps can schedule jobs while letting the system optimize based on memory, power, and connectivity conditions.
