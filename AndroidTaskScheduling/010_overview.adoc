== Scheduling tasks
=== How not to do it

If you have a repetitive task in your Android app, you cannot reply on a `TimerTask` or similar approaches.
Activities and services can be terminated at any point in time by the Android system to free up resources.
Therefore the following code snippet would be wrong.

			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/schedule/wrong.java" />
			</programlisting>
	
=== Options for scheduling

The Android system currently has two main means to schedule task, the `AlarmManager` and the `JobScheduler` API.
Modern Android apps should use the `JobScheduler` API.  
Apps can schedule jobs while letting the system optimize based on memory, power, and connectivity conditions.
