		<title>Target of this exercise
		
			This is the second part of an exercise which started in
			<xref linkend="intentexercise_chapter_start" />
			. An example solution for the activity can be found in
			<xref linkend="intentexercise_chapter_solution" />
			.
		
		
			Continue to use the
			`com.vogella.android.intent.explicit`
			project.
		
		
			In the following exercise you transfer data back from your
			second sub-activity
			to the
			`MainActivity`
			once the user selects the
			<guilabel>Back</guilabel>
			button.

			class.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"

		<title>Evaluate the return data in MainActivity
		
			Use
			the
			`startActivityForResult()`
			method
			in
			`MainActivity`
			to start the sub-activity. This allows you to use the
			`onActivityResult()`
			method to receive data from the sub-activity.
			Extract the extra data with
			the received bundle.
		
		
			Show a
			`Toast`
			with the extra data to validate that you correctly received it. The
			following code contains some pointer on how to solve that.
