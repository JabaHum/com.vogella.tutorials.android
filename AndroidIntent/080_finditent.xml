	<title>Determine valid intent receivers
	
		Sometimes you want to determine if a component has registered
		for an intent.
		For example, you want to check if a certain intent
		receiver is
		available and in case a component is available, you enable a
		functionality in your application.
	
	
		This check can be done via the
		`PackageManager`
		class.
	
	
		The
		following example
		code checks
		if a component has registered for
		a
		certain intent.
		Construct your intent
		as you are desired to trigger it and pass it to the following method.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/check/check.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Based on the result you can adjust your application. For
		example,
		you could
		disable or
		hide certain menu items.
