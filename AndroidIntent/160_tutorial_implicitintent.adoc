	<title>Exercise: Using different implicit intents
	<section id="exercise_implicitintent1">
		<title>Target
		
			The following exercise demonstrates the usage of implicit
			intents
			to trigger
			activities
			in your Android system.
		
	
	<section id="exercise_implicitintent2">
		<title>Create project
		
			Create a new Android application called
			_de.vogella.android.intent.implicit_
			with the activity
			called
			`CallIntentsActivity`
			.
		
		
			In this example you use a
			`Spinner`
			view
			to select which intent
			is triggered. For the content of the
			`Spinner`
			you define static values.
		
		
			Create the following
			_intents.xml_
			file in the
			_res/values_
			folder.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/implicit/intents.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			Change the layout file of the activity
			to the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/implicit/main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			To be able to use certain intents, you need to register for the
			required permission in your
			_AndroidManifest.xml_
			file.
			Ensure that your
			_AndroidManifest.xml_
			contains the permissions from the following listing.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/implicit/AndroidManifest.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Change your activity class to the following code.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/implicit/CallIntentsActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="exercise_implicitintent3">
		<title>Validating
		
			If you start your application, you see a list of buttons
			and if
			you press one of the buttons, your defined activities are started.
		
		<note>
			
				Note that you didn't specify any receiving application, only the
				action that should be done. This allows you to define loosely coupled
				tasks which use components of different applications.
			
		</note>
