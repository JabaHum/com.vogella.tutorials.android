== Exercise: Using the share intent

Extend the layout of your activity
with another button.
A click on this
`Button`
should allow to share the text of the
`EditText`
button.
The value
for sending data via other applications is defined via
the
`Intent.ACTION_SEND`
constant.
To share data, create a new method called
`public void shareData(View view)`
based on
the following snippet
in your activity.
[source,java]
----
Intent sharingIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sharingIntent.setType("text/plain");
sharingIntent.putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "REPLACE WITH YOUR TEXT");

startActivity(sharingIntent);
----


Connect this method with your button via
`android:onClick`
property in your layout file, pointing to your new method.
Run this application and select your button. On the
Android emulator
most
likely only the SMS application has registered for the
intent
and is started directly.
