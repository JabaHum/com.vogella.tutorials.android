== Intents and intent filter

=== Task
        
In Android the reuse of other application components is a concept known as _task_. 
An application can access other Android components to achieve a task.
For example, from a component of your application you can trigger another component in the Android system, which manages photos, even if this component is not part of your application. 
In this component you select a photo and return to your application to use the selected photo.
        
Such a flow of events is depicted in the following graphic.

=== What are intents?
		
_Intents_ are asynchronous messages which allow application components to request functionality from other Android components. 
Intents allow you to interact with components from the same applications as well as with components contributed by other applications.
For example, an activity can start an external activity for taking a picture.
		
		
Intents are objects of the `android.content.Intent` type. 
Your code can send them to the Android system defining the components you are targeting. 
For example, via the `startActivity()` method you can define that the intent should be used to start an activity.
		
		
An intent can contain data via a `Bundle`. 
This data can be used by the receiving component.

=== Starting activities
		
To start an activity, use the method `startActivity(intent)`. 
This method is defined on the `Context` object which `Activity` extends.

The following code demonstrates how you can start another activity via an intent.
		
[source,java]
----

=== Sub-activities
		
Activities which are started by other Android activities are called _sub-activities_. 
This wording makes it easier to describe which activity is meant.
		
=== Starting services
		
You can also start services via intents. 
Use the `startService(Intent)` method call for that.
