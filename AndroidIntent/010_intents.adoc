            In Android the reuse of other application components is a concept
            known
            as
            _task_
            . An application can access other Android components to achieve a
            task.
            For example, from a component of your application you can
            trigger
            another component in the Android system, which manages photos,
            even
            if
            this component is not part of your application. In this
            component you
            select a photo and return to your application to use the
            selected
            photo.
        
        Such a flow of events is depicted in the following graphic.

		<title>What are intents?
		
			_Intents_
			are asynchronous messages which allow
			application components to
			request
			functionality from other Android components.
			Intents allow you
			to
			interact with components from the same applications as well as with components contributed by other applications.
			For example, an activity
			can start an external activity for
			taking a
			picture.
		
		
			Intents are objects of the
			`android.content.Intent`
			type. Your code can send them to the
			Android system defining the
			components you are targeting. For example, via
			the
			`startActivity()`
			method you can define that the intent should be used to start an
			activity.
		
		
			An
			intent
			can contain data via a
			`Bundle`
			. This data can be used by the receiving
			component.

		<title>Starting activities
		
			To start an activity,
			use the method
			`startActivity(intent)`
			. This method is defined on the
			`Context`
			object which
			`Activity`
			extends.

		<title>Sub-activities
		
			Activities which are started by other Android activities are
			called
			_sub-activities_
			. This wording makes it easier to describe which activity is meant.
		
	

	<section id="usingintents_startservice">
		<title>Starting services
		
			You can also start
			services
			via intents.
			Use the
			`startService(Intent)`
			method call
			for that.
