		<title>Intent filter
		
			Intents
			are used to
			signal to the Android system that a
			certain
			event
			has
			occurred. Intents often describe the action which should be
			performed and provide data upon which such an action should be done.
			For example, your application can start
			a
			browser
			component
			for a certain URL
			via an intent.
			This is
			demonstrated by the
			following example.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/startBrowser.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			But how does
			the Android
			system identify the
			components
			which can
			react
			to a certain intent?
		
		
			A component can register itself via an
			_intent filter_ for a specific action and specific data.
			An intent filter specifies the types of
			intents to which
			an
			activity,
			service, or
			broadcast
			receiver
			can respond to by
			declaring
			the capabilities of
			a component.
		
		
			Android components
			register
			intent filters
			either statically in the
			_AndroidManifest.xml_
			or in case of a broadcast receiver also dynamically via code. An
			intent filter
			is defined by its category, action
			and data filters. It
			can also
			contain additional meta-data.
		
		
			If an
			intent is sent to the Android system, the Android platform
			runs
			a receiver
			determination. It uses
			the data
			included
			in the intent.
			If
			several
			components
			have registered
			for the
			same intent
			filter,
			the user
			can decide which
			component should be
			started.

		<title>Defining intent filter
		
			You can register your Android components via intent filters for
			certain events.
			If a
			component does not
			define one, it can only be
			called by explicit
			intents. This chapter gives an example for
			registering a component
			for an intent. The key for this registration
			is that your component
			registers for the correct action, mime-type and
			specifies the correct
			meta-data.
		
		
			If you send such an intent
			to your system, the
			Android system
			determines all registered
			Android components for
			this intent. If
			several
			components have registered for this
			intent,
			the user can select
			which one
			should be used.

		<title>Example: Register an activity as browser
		
			The following code will register an

				Activity
			_
			for the

				Intent

			which is triggered when someone wants to open a webpage.

		<title>Example: Register an activity for the share intent
		
			The following example registers an activity for the
			`ACTION_SEND`
			intent. It declares itself only relevant for the
			`text/plain`
			mime type.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/sendfilter.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			If a component does not
			define an
			intent
			filter, it can only be called by explicit
			intents.
