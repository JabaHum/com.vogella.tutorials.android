== Intents as event triggers
	
Intents can be used to send broadcast messages into the Android system.
A _broadcast receiver_ can register to an event and is notified if such an event is sent.
	
Your application can register to system events, e.g., a new email has arrived, system boot is complete or a phone call is received and react accordingly.
