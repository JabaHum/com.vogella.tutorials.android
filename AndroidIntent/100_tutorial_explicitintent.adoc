		<title>Target of this exercise
		
			The following exercise demonstrates how to use an explicit
			intent
			to start a sub-activity and
			how
			to send data to it.
		
		
			This is the first part of an exercise continued in
			<xref linkend="intentexercise_chapter_second" />
			. The final solution can be found in
			<xref linkend="intentexercise_chapter_solution" />
			.
		
	

	<section id="explicit_intentslayout">
		<title>Create project and main layout
		
			Create a new Android project called
			_com.vogella.android.intent.explicit_
			with an activity called
			`MainActivity`
			.
		

		
			Change the layout file of this activity to the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/explicit/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
	<section id="explicit_intentlayoutsecondactivity">
		<title>Create new layout file
		
			Create a new layout called
			_activity_result.xml_
			. In the next step you create a new activity which will use this
			layout file.
		
		
		
			Enter
			_activity_result.xml_
			as file name and press
			the
			<guibutton>Finish</guibutton>
			button. Change your layout so that it is similar to the following XML
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/explicit/activity_result.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

	<section id="exercise_explicitintents2">
		<title>Create additional activity
		
			Create a new
			class called
			`ResultActivity`
			based on the following example code.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/explicit/ResultActivity0.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Add a new activity called
			_ResultActivity_
			to the
			_AndroidManifest.xml_
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/explicit/AndroidManifest.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		

		<note>
			
				This new activity will be started via the
				`MainActivity`
				, hence
				it is called a sub-activity.
			
		</note>
	

	<section id="explicit_startsubactivity">
		<title>Start sub-activity
		
			Start the sub-activity via a button click from the
			`MainActivity`
			class. The following code gives some pointers on how to solve this.
			Solve the TODO's in the source code so that the
			`ResultActivity`
			activity
			is started from the
			`onClick()`
			method.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/explicit/MainActivity1.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Once you finished this part of the exercise, start your
			application and ensure that you can start the second activity.
		
	

	<section id="explicit_intentssend">
		<title>Send data to ResultActivity
		
			The
			`MainActivity`
			class
			should pass the value of the
			`EditText`
			view
			to the sub-activity.
			For this use the
			`putExtra("yourKey", string)`
			on the
			`Intent`
			object.
		
	

	<section id="explicit_intentsreceivedata">
		<title>Get intent data in the ResultActivity
		
			In your
			`ResultActivity`
			sub-activity
			get the
			`Bundle`
			with the intent data via the
			`getIntent().getExtras()`
			) method call.
		
		
			Get the value of the passed extra with the
			`extras.getString("yourkey")`
			method on the bundle object which you got with the
			`getExtras()`
			call.
		
		
			This value should be placed in the
			`TextView`
			with the
			`displayintentextra`
			ID.
