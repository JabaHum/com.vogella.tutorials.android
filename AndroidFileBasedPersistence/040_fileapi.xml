		<title>Using the file API

		
			Access to the file system is performed via the standard
			`java.io`
			classes.
			Android provides also helper classes for creating and
			accessing new
			files and directories.
			For example the
			`getDir(String, int)`
			method
			would create or
			access a directory. The
			`openFileInput(String s)`
			method
			would
			open
			a file for input
			and
			`openFileOutput(String s, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)`
			would
			create a
			file.
		
		
			Android supports world readable or writable files, but it is
			considered good practice to keep files private to the application and
			use content provider if you want to share data with other
			applications.
		
		The following example shows the API usage.

		<title>External storage
		Android supports also access to an external storage system e.g.
			the SD card. All files and
			directories on the external storage system
			are readable for all
			applications with the correct permission.
		
		
			To read from external storage your application need to have the
			`android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
			permission.
		

		
			To
			write to
			the external storage system your application needs the
			`android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
			permission. You get the path to the
			external storage system via the
			`Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()`
			method.
		
		
			Via the following

			method call you can
			check the state of the
			external storage system. If the Android
			device is
			connected via USB to
			a computer, a
			SD
			card which might be used for the external storage
			system is
			not
			available.
