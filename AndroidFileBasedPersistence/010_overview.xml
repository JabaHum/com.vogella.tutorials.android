			Android
			allows to persists application data via the file system. For
			each application the Android system creates a
			<filename class="diretory">data/data/[application package]</filename>
			directory.
		</para>
		<para>
			Android supports the following ways of storing data in the local file
			system:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Files - You can create and update files
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Preferences - Android allows you to
						save and
						retrieve
						persistent
						key-value
						pairs of primitive data type.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>SQLite database - instances of
						SQLite databases are also
						stored on the local
						file
						system.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>

		</para>
		<para>
			Files
			are saved in the
			<filename class="diretory">files</filename>
			folder and
			application
			settings are
			saved
			as
			XML files in the
			<filename class="diretory">shared_prefs</filename>
			folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			If your application creates an
			SQLite database
			this
			database is
			saved in
			the
			main application directory under the
			<filename class="diretory">databases</filename>
			folder.
		</para>
		<para>The following screenshot shows a file system which contains
			file,

				<textobject>
					<phrase>Screenshot of the file system with a few files</phrase>

		<title>Internal vs. external storage</title>
		<para>Android has internal storage and external storage. External
			storage is not private and may not always be available. If for
			example the Android device is connected with a computer, the computer
			may mount the external system via USB and that makes this external
			storage not avaiable for Android applications.
		</para>

	<section id="overview_externalstorage">
		<title>Application on external storage</title>
		<para>
			As of Android 8 SDK level it is possible to define that the
			application
			can or
			should be placed on external storage. For this set
			the
			<code>android:installLocation</code>
			to preferExternal or auto.
		</para>
		<para>In this case certain application components may be stored on an
			encrypted external mount point. Database and other private data will
			still be stored in the internal storage system.
