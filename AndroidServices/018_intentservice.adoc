== IntentServices for one time tasks
		
You can also extend the
`IntentService`
class for your service implementation.
		
The
`IntentService`
is used to perform a certain task in the background. Once
done, the
instance of
`IntentService`
terminates itself automatically. An example for its usage would be
downloading certain resources from the internet.
		
The
`IntentService`
class offers the
`onHandleIntent()`
method which will be asynchronously called by the Android system.
