		<title>Implementation and declaration
		
			A
			service
			needs to be declared in the
			_AndroidManifest.xml_
			file
			and the implementing class must extend the
			`Service`
			class
			or one
			of
			its subclasses.
		
		
			The following code shows an example for
			a
			service
			declaration and
			its implementation.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/service/defineservicelocal.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/define/MyService.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

	<section id="service_start">
		<title>Start a service
		
			An Android component (service, receiver, activity)
			can trigger the
			execution of a service via
			the
			`startService(intent)`
			method.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/define/Start.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Alternatively,
			you can also start a
			service
			via the
			`bindService()`
			method call. This allows you to communicate directly with the
			_service_.
			We discuss that later.
		
	

	<section id="service_execution">
		<title>Service start process and execution
		
			If the
			`startService(intent)`
			method is called and the
			service is not yet running, the service
			object is
			created and
			the
			`onCreate()`
			method of the service is called.
		
		
			Once the
			_service_
			is started, the
			`onStartCommand(intent)`
			method in the
			_service_
			is called.
			It passes in the
			`Intent`
			object
			from the
			`startService(intent)`
			call.
		
		
			If
			`startService(intent)`
			is called while the service
			is running, its
			`onStartCommand()`
			is also called. Therefore your
			service
			needs to be prepared that
			`onStartCommand()`
			can be called several times.
		
		TIP:
			
				What if you call this method twice in your code? Do you have to
				worry about synchronizing the
				`onStartCommand()`
				method call? No, this method is called by the Android system in the
				main user
				interface thread,
				therefore it cannot be called
				simultaneously from
				two different
				threads.
			
		</tip>
		
		
			A service is only started once, no matter how often you call the
			`startService()`
			method.
		
	

	<section id="service_restart">
		<title>Service restart behavior
		
			In its
			`onStartCommand()`
			method call, the service returns an
			`int`
			which defines its restart behavior in case the service gets terminated
			by the Android platform. You can use the constants, the most common
			options are described by the following table.
			<table frame='all'>
				<title>Restart options
				<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
					<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*" />
					<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="2*" />
					<thead>
						<row>
							<entry>Option</entry>
							<entry>Description</entry>
						</row>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>Service.START_STICKY</entry>
							<entry>
								Service is restarted if it gets terminated. Intent data
								passed
								to the
								`onStartCommand`
								method
								is null. Used for services which manages their own state
								and do not depend on the `Intent` data.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Service.START_NOT_STICKY</entry>
							<entry>
								Service is not restarted. Used for services which are
								periodically triggered anyway. The service is only restarted if
								the runtime has pending
								`startService()`
								calls since the service termination.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Service.START_REDELIVER_INTENT</entry>
							<entry>
								Similar to Service.START_STICKY but the original `Intent` is
								re-delivered to the
								`onStartCommand`
								method.
							</entry>
						</row>
					</tbody>
				</tgroup>
			</table>
		
		TIP:
			
				You can check if the service was restarted via the
				`Intent.getFlags()`
				method.
				`START_FLAG_REDELIVERY`
				(in case the service was started with
				Service.START_REDELIVER_INTENT)
				or
				`START_FLAG_RETRY`
				(in case the service was started with Service.START_STICKY)
				is
				passed.

	<section id="service_stop">
		<title>Stopping a service
		
			You
			stop
			a
			service
			via the
			`stopService()`
			method. No matter how frequently you called the
			`startService(intent)`
			method, one
			call to the
			`stopService()`
			method
			stops the service.
		
		
			A
			service
			can terminate itself by calling the
			`stopSelf()`
			method. This is typically done if the service finishes its work.
