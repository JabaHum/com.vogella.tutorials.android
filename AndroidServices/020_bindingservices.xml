			If the
			activity
			wants to
			interact with the
			service directly,
			it can use
			the
			<code>bindService()</code>
			method to start the
			<wordasword>service</wordasword>.
		</para>
		<para>
			This method requires a
			<code>ServiceConnection</code>
			object as a parameter which is called on the service start and when finishing its
			<code>onBind()</code>
			method. This method
			returns a
			<code>IBinder</code>
			object to the
			<code>ServiceConnection</code>.
		</para>
		<para>
			This
			<code>IBinder</code>
			object
			can be used
			by the
			activity
			to communicate
			with the
			service.
		</para>
		<para>
			When the binding process has finished, the
			<code>onStartCommand()</code>
			method in the service is called with the
			<code>Intent</code>
			object used for the
			<code>bindService()</code>
			method.

			If the service runs in the same process as the activity, it is
			possible to return the service to the activity. This allows that the
			activity can call methods of the service directly. This technique is
			demonstrated by <xref linkend="exercise_bindlocalservice" />.

			If the service run in its own process, you require IPC
			(Interprocess
			Communication) to communicate with the service. See
