			You can also specify that your
			<code>Service</code>
			runs in
			a separate
			process via the
			<code><![CDATA[ android:process=":process_description" ]]></code>
			attribute.

		<para>
			The colon prefix in front of the name tells Android that the
			<code>Service</code>
			is private to its declaring application. If the colon is not used, the
			<code>Service</code>
			would be a global process and can be used by other Android
			applications.
		</para>
		<para>
			Running a service in its own process will not block the
			application in case the service performs long running operations in
			its main thread. But as the services runs in its own process, you need
			to use some interprocess communication (IPC) to communicate to your
			service from other parts.
		</para>
		<para>
			Even if the service
			runs in its own process, you need to use
			asynchronous processing
			to
			perform
			network access, because Android does not allow network access
			in the main thread of a process.

		<title>When to run a service in a separate process?</title>
		<para>
			Running a service
			in its own process gives it its own memory
			address space and a
			garbage collector of the virtual machine in this
			process does not
			affect the application process.
		</para>
		<para>
			Application rarely need to run a service
			in its own process.
			Running
			services in its own process makes the
			communication with
			other
			Android components and the
			service
			harder to implement.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				If you want to make a service
				to other Android application
				available, they must run in their own
				process.
