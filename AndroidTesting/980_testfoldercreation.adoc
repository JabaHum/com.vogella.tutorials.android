If not yet done, also add the JUnit dependency to your Gradle build file.

[source,gradle]
----
include::examples/unittests/simple.gradle[]

[WARNING]
====
The creation of the Java folder might add the new test directory as source file to your build.gradle file. 
If you have the following entry in your `app/build.gradle` file you need to REMOVE it. 
test should NOT be treated as normale source folder.

[source,java]
----
include::examples/unittests/wrongentry.txt[]

Afterwards you can add your unit test to this folder structure.
