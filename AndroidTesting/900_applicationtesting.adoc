== Application testing

The application class contains the logic, data and settings which are relevant for the whole application.
Therefore you should test this object, to ensure it works correctly.

You can write JUnit 4 for the application object and test it on the JVM. 
In this case you would mock all dependencies to the application object.
To test an Android application object on the Android runtime you use the `ApplicationTestCase` class. 
It is expected that Google will soon provide a special JUnit4 rule for testing the application object but at the moment his is not yet available.

The test runner of the Android tests (`InstrumentationTestRunner`) creates automatically an instance of application during its initialization phase. 
If you do asynchronous processing in your `onCreate` method you should consider that.
