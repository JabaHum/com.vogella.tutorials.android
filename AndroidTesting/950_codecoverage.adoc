== Creating code coverage report

A code coverage report shows you how much of your application code is covered by tests. 
To create such a report, you can create a separate launch configuration.
For this, select your package and select menu:[Create Tests in...].

You can now create a runtime configuration for the code coverage. 
If you run it a report is generated.
