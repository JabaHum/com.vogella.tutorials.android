== More on recyler view

=== Relevant implementation classes to use RecyclerView
		
The implementation of `RecyclerView` requires a few classes to be implemented.
The most important classes are listed in the following table

.Table Important classes of the RecyclerView API
[cols="1, 3, 1"]
|===
|Class |Purpose|Optional

|Adapter
|Provides the data and responsible for creating the views for the individual entry
|Required

|ViewHolder
|Contains references for all views that are filled by the data of the entry
|Required

|LayoutManager
|Contains references for all views that are filled by the data of the entry
|Required, but default implementations available

|ItemDecoration
|Responsible for drawing decorations around or on top of the view container of an entry
|Default behavior, but can be overridden

|ItemAnimator
|Responsible to define the animation if entries are added, removed or reordered
|Default behavior, but can be overridden

You can also provide your custom implementations for the layout managers and animations.
		

=== Handling click events in RecylerView
Touch events, like clicking should be handled by the views in the recycler view. 
If the view should trigger something in the object in which it is used (activity or fragment), you can pass via the constructor of the adapter to it. 
This allows the adapter to store a reference to the object and call its methods for feedback.
		

=== Using different layouts in recycler view
		
The adapter needs to create a layout for each row of the list.
This root of the layout is typically a
`ViewGroup`
(layout manager)
and contains several other
views
, e.g., an
`ImageView`
and a
`TextView`
. The following graphic shows a list with different layouts for odd
and even rows.

Within the
`getItemViewType`
method the recycler view determines which type should be used for data. The framework call automatically the
`onCreateViewHolder`
method if needed for this type. In this method you inflate the correct layout for the type and return a fitting view
holder.
		

=== Custom animations
		
To customize the animations in the `RecyclerView`, implement your own animation by extending the
`RecyclerView.ItemAnimator`
class and use the RecyclerView.setItemAnimator() method to assign it
to your widget.
		
=== Filtering and sorting
		
Filtering and sorting of the data is handled by the adapter. 
You need to implement the logic in your custom adapter implementation.
		
=== Data updates in the adapter
		
The `notifyItemInserted(position)` method on the adapter can be used to notify the view that a new entry has been inserted at a certain position.
		
The `notifyItemRemoved(position);` method can be used to notify the view that a entry has been deleted in a certain position.
