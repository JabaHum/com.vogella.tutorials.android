== Android and list or grids

=== Using lists or grids in Android
		
The display of elements in a list or grids is a very common pattern in mobile applications.
The user sees a collection of items and can scroll through them. 
The collection of items can be a list, a grid or another structured representations of data.
Such an activity is depicted in the following picture.

The user interacts with the collection of items via touch events or the toolbar.
Individual items can be selected. 
This selection may update the toolbar or may trigger a detailed screen based on the selection.
The following graphic sketches that.

=== Using RecyclerView 
		
The `RecyclerView` class supports the display of a collection of data.

It is a modernized version of the `ListView` and the `GridView` classes provided by the Android framework.
Recycler view addresses several issues that the existing widgets have.
It enforced a programming style that results in good performance.
It also comes with default animations for removing and adding elements.
		
`RecyclerView` allow to use different layout managers for positioning items.

		
=== Using a view holder
		
		
Recyler view uses a `ViewHolder` to store references to the views for one entry in the recyler view. 
A `ViewHolder` class is a static inner class in your adapter which holds references to the relevant views. 
With these references your code can avoid the time-consuming `findViewById()` method to update the widgets with new data.
		
=== Adapters
		
An _adapter_ manages the data model and adapts it to the individual entries in the widget. 
An adapter for recyler view extends the `RecyclerView.Adapter` sclass.
		
		
Every entry in a recycler view consists of a view hierarchy filled with the data model. 
For example, an entry in a list may have an image on the left side and two text lines in the middle as depicted in the following graphic.

A layout file for a such a line might look like the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/snippets/rowlayout_complex.xml[]
----
		
		
The adapter is responsible for inflating the layout for each entry in recycler view. 
It returns an object of type `ViewHolder`per visual entry in the recycler view.
		
		
The adapter must return the number of items via its `getItemCount()` method.
Each entry in the `RecylerView` widget displays specific data for the data model. 
The adapter inflates a corresponding layout file and assigns the data to the inflated layout.
		

		
The `onCreateViewHolder` method inflate the layout and creates an instance of the `ViewHolder` class. 
This instance is used to access the views in the inflated layout. 
The `onCreateViewHolder` method is only called then a new view must be created.
		

The `onBindViewHolder` method binds the data to the individual views in the row.
		
The adapter is assigned to the `RecylerView` via the `setAdapter` method on the `RecylerView` object.
		

=== Possible input types for the adapter
		
The input to the adapter of `RecyclerView` can be any arbitrary Java objects. 
The `RecyclerView` adapter extracts the correct item data from the data model.
Afterwards it assigns this data to the individual widgets in the entry of the recyler view widget.

=== Default layout manager
		
The layout manager decides how the data in the `RecyclerView` is displayed. 
The library for recyler view provides the following build-in layout managers.

* LinearLayoutManager shows items in a vertical or horizontal scrolling list.
* GridLayoutManager shows items in a grid.
* StaggeredGridLayoutManager shows items in a staggered grid.
