== Tutorial: Record media via MediaRecorder
	
We will create an application which will start playing a sound
once
the
finger touches the display. Create an
Android
project called
"de.vogella.android.media.soundrecording" with an
_activity_
called
_RecordSound_.
	
Add to the AndroidManifest.xml file the permission to write to
the SD card and to record audio data.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/record/permission.txt[]
----	

Change the layout _main.xml_ to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/record/main.xml[]
----	
	
Change your
_activity_
class to the following.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/record/SoundRecordingActivity.java[]
----	
	
You should be able to record a sound, if you press the "Start
Recording" button. Once you press the stop recording button, the
recording will be stopped and the file will be added to your media
library.
