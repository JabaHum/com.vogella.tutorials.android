== Tutorial: Play sounds via SoundPool
	
We will create an application which will start playing a sound
once
the finger touches the display. Create an
Android
project called "de.vogella.android.soundpool" with an Activity called
_PlaySound_.
	
Change the layout _main.xml_ to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/sound/main.xml[]
----	
	
Download a sound which you want to play. 
For example the Free Sound Effects at http://hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Free_Sound_Effects.html
site contains several free sound examples.
	
Put the sound file into your "res/raw" folder under the name
"sound1.ogg". This assumes that you downloaded an ogg file.
	
Create the following coding for your activity. 
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/sound/PlaySound.java[]
----	
	
If you touch your
_activity_
your sound should be played. It will use
the current volume settings.
