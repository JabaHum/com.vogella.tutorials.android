	<title>Tutorial: Record media via MediaRecorder
	
		We will create an application which will start playing a sound
		once
		the
		finger touches the display. Create an
		Android
		project called
		"de.vogella.android.media.soundrecording" with an
		_activity_
		called
		_RecordSound_.
	
	Add to the AndroidManifest.xml file the permission to write to
		the SD card and to record audio data.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/record/permission.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	



	 Change the layout _main.xml_ to the following.

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/record/main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
	
	
		Change your
		_activity_
		class to the following.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/record/SoundRecordingActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		You should be able to record a sound, if you press the "Start
		Recording" button. Once you press the stop recording button, the
		recording will be stopped and the file will be added to your media
		library.
