		<title>Playing sound
		
			Android
			provides two main API's for playing sounds. The first one via
			the
			`SoundPool`
			class
			and
			the other one via the
			`MediaPlayer`
			class.
		
		
			`SoundPool`
			can be used for small audio clips. It can
			repeat
			sounds and
			play several
			sounds simultaneously. The sound files
			played
			with
			`SoundPool`
			should not exceed 1 MB.
		
		
			`SoundPool`
			does load the file asynchronously. As of Android API8
			it is possible
			to check if the loading is
			complete via a
			`OnLoadCompleteListener`
			.
		
		 Android supports different audio streams for different
			purposes.
			The phone volume button can be configured to control a
			specific audio
			stream, e.g. during a call the volume button allow
			increase /
			decrease
			the caller volume. To set the button to control the
			sound media stream
			set the audio type in your application.

			`MediaPlayer`
			is better
			suited for
			longer music and movies.

			available. The following
			demonstrates that.
