	<title>Tutorial: Play sounds via SoundPool
	
		We will create an application which will start playing a sound
		once
		the finger touches the display. Create an
		Android
		project called "de.vogella.android.soundpool" with an Activity called
		_PlaySound_.
	
	 Change the layout _main.xml_ to the following.

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/sound/main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Download a sound which you want to play. For example the
		http://hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Free_Sound_Effects.html">
			Free Sound Effects</ulink>
		site contains several free sound examples.
	
	

		Put the sound file into your "res/raw" folder under the name
		"sound1.ogg". This assumes that you downloaded an ogg file.
	
	 Create the following coding for your activity. 
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/sound/PlaySound.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		If you touch your
		_activity_
		your sound should be played. It will use
		the current volume settings.
