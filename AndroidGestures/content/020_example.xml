	<title>Example
	Create a new Android project "de.vogella.android.gestures" with
		the activity "GestureTest". Create a few gestures and copy them to
		your application as described in the
		last chapter.    

	
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata fileref="images/gesture10.png" />
				
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
	
	
		Unfortunately the UI builder does not support GestureOverlayView,
		please see
		http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13686">Bug report GestureOverlayView not working in the
			layout
			builder</ulink>
		, therefore we have to build a layout without the gesture view and add
		this view via code to the GestureOverlayView.
	
	 Create the following layout _main.xml_. 
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/gestures/main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	 Create the following Activity. 
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/gestures/GestureTest.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	 Start your application. As a result you should be able to perform gestures and see the
		result. We only show a Toast but of course you could perform all kind of actions.
