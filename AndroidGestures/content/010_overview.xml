	<title>Android Gestures
	Android supports gestures. To use this support your application
		must use the view "GestureOverlayView". In this view you place your
		other
		views. 
		
	
		Gestures are defined by a binary resources which can be created
		with an example program from the Android SDK. In your activity you
		can
		load Gestures via GestureLib.fromRawResource(). If a gesture is
		detected then the method "onGesturePerformedListener" is called. For
		this the activity must implement the interface
		"OnGesturePerformedListener" and must register itself at the
		GestureOverlayView with the method "addOnGesturePerformedListener()".
	
	 Android shows the gestures in yellow for recognized gestures and
		a ligher yellow for not recognized gestures. You can turn this off,
		via setGestureColor(Color.TRANSPARENT) or
		setUncertainGestureColor(Color.TRANSPARENT) on the GestureOverlayView.
	
	 If you create the gesture in the Android simulator via the
		program "GestureBuilder". You can create several gestures with the
		same name. That may help you to determine the right one. If you
		create
		an Android Emulator for
		Android 1.6 this application will be
		preinstalled on your device. Make
		sure to create a device with sdcard
		otherwise you cannot save
		gestures. All gestures will be saved in a
		file called _gestures_ on your emulator. 
		
		
	You
		can copy the gestures from the emulator via the adb onto your
		local
		machine via the
		command:
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/adb/adbcopy" />
		</programlisting>
	
	 The gesture file must be copied into your application under
		"res/raw". Afterwards it
		can be used in your GestureOverlayView.
