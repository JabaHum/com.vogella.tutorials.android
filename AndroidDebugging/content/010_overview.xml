		<title>Android debuggable attribute in the AndroidManifest.xml
		
			If you develop Android applications you can debug them via
			Eclipse. To
			enable debugging an a real Android device you need to add
			the
			android:debuggable="true" flag to the application segment in your
			<filename>AndroidManifest.xml</filename>
			file. The ADT tooling sets this flag automatically for debug builds
			based on the constant
			`DEBUG`
			of the
			`BuildConfig`
			class. This class is automatically updated by the ADT.

		<title>Turn debugging on at runtime in Eclipse

		
			The JVM requires that you start a Java program in
			_Debug_
			mode to debug it. Android allows you to turn debugging for a running
			application on at runtime via the
			<guilabel>Debug</guilabel>
			button in the
			<guilabel>Device</guilabel>
			view
			of the
			<guilabel>DDMS</guilabel>
			_perspective_
			as depicted in the following screenshot.

			After turning debugging on in this view, the next time a
			_Breakpoint_
			is encountered Eclipse allows you to debug the process.
