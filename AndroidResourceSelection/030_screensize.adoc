== Screen density

=== Why handling different screen densities?
		
Screens of Android devices are different in terms of resolution and in terms of density of the pixels on the screen.
		
In case of a different screen densities the same length of a user interface component consists of a different amount of pixels.
		
For example, if you specify the pixels directly, you might get the following result on a device with a relatively low number of pixels.

Using the same number of pixels on a device with more pixels might lead to an unusable graphical user interface.

For this reason you should provide graphical resources, e.g., the laucher and action bar icons in different resolutions. 
This can be done by using resource qualifiers based on the pixel desity.
		
=== Using density as resource qualifier
		
You can use the density as resource qualifier. 
Android support the following selections. 
The baseline is 160 dots per inch (dpi). 
If for example the Android device has 320 dpi, the Drawable from the _drawable-hdpi_ is selected.

.Density resource selector
|===
|Density selector |Equals

|ldpi
|160 dpi x 0.75

|mdpi
|160 dpi

|hdip
|1.5 x 160 dpi = 240 dpi

|xhdpi
|2 x 160 dpi = 320 dpi

|xxhdpi
|3 x 160 dpi = 480 dpi

|xxxhdpi
|4 x 160 dpi = 640 dpi

=== Icon sizes
You should provide your launcher, action bar and notification bar icons in the important five size.
		
.Android icons size

|Icons |mdpi |hdpi |xhdpi |xxhdpi |xxxhdpi

|Launcher icon	
|48 px	
|72 px	
|96 px	
|144 px	
|192 px

|Action bar icon	
|32 px	
|48 px	
|64 px	
|96 px	
|128 px

|Notification icon	
|24 px	
|36 px	
|48 px	
|72 px	
|96 px

The launch icon should also be provide in 512x512 px for the published application in Google Play.
