		<title>Handling different Android devices
		Android device comes in a variety of different configurations in
			the sense of size, screen pixel density, language settings, etc.
		
		To provide the correct resources and setting for these different
			configurations, Android support the automatic selection of resources
			and the definition of the size of user interface components in a
			relative size format (device independent pixel).

		<title>Resource qualifiers
		
			Android allows you to use resource qualifiers to specify that
			certain
			resources should only be used for a specific device configuration
			(e.g., orientation, resolution, languages). To provide
			different
			resource files, e.g., layouts for
			configurations described by a
			<parameter>qualifier</parameter>
			selector, you should create
			a new sub-folder
			in the
			<filename class="directory">res</filename>
			folder
			using this qualifier, for example,
			<filename class="directory">layout-qualifier</filename>
			for layouts.
		
		<note>
			
				Android selects the correct file automatically based
				on the
				current configuration.
