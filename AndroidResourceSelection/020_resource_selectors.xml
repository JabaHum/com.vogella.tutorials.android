        <title>Using orientation as resource qualifier
        
            Assume, for example, that you want to use a
            special
            layout for your
            activity
            in
            landscape
            mode and that the layout file is called
            <filename>activity_main.xml</filename>
            .
            In this case you create the
            <filename class="directory">res/layout-land</filename>
            folder and place
            the new layout file with the same name (
            <filename>activity_main.xml</filename>
            )
            in this folder.
        
    

    <section id="resourcequalifiers_version">
        <title>Android version qualifiers
        
            A typical selection you use in your application, is
            the
            selection based
            on Android version, which is based on the
            <parameter>-v[minimum API level]</parameter>
            qualifier. For example, this way you can provide different styling
            and
            themes based on the Android API revision.
        
        
            A typical example for using this qualifier is to define the
            styling based on the Android version.
        
    
    <section id="resourcequalifiers_size">
        <title>Width and height related qualifiers
        
            Another typical selection is the
            _smallest available width_
            selection or the
            _available width_
            selection. The
            _smallest available width_
            is the shortest of the screen's available
            height and the
            _available width_
            is the actual width based on the orientation of the device.
        
        
            The width selection
            can, for example, be used
            to provide different
            layouts
            based on the width of the device.
            This
            selection is based on
            <parameter>-sw[Number]dp</parameter>
            (Smallest) or
            <parameter>-w[Number]dp</parameter>
            qualifier, where
            [Number] stands for the number of device independent
            pixels. For example, a 7inch tablet typically has at least 600dp and
            you could provide layouts for it via the
            <parameter>res/layout-sw600dp/</parameter>
            selector.
