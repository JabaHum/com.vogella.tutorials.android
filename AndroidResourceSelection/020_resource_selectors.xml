        <para>
            Assume, for example, that you want to use a
            special
            layout for your
            activity
            in
            landscape
            mode and that the layout file is called
            <filename>activity_main.xml</filename>
            .
            In this case you create the
            <filename class="directory">res/layout-land</filename>
            folder and place
            the new layout file with the same name (
            <filename>activity_main.xml</filename>
            )
            in this folder.

    <section id="resourcequalifiers_version">
        <title>Android version qualifiers</title>
        <para>
            A typical selection you use in your application, is
            the
            selection based
            on Android version, which is based on the
            <parameter>-v[minimum API level]</parameter>
            qualifier. For example, this way you can provide different styling
            and
            themes based on the Android API revision.
        </para>
        <para>
            A typical example for using this qualifier is to define the
            styling based on the Android version.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="resourcequalifiers_size">
        <title>Width and height related qualifiers</title>
        <para>
            Another typical selection is the
            <wordasword>smallest available width</wordasword>
            selection or the
            <wordasword>available width</wordasword>
            selection. The
            <wordasword>smallest available width</wordasword>
            is the shortest of the screen's available
            height and the
            <wordasword>available width</wordasword>
            is the actual width based on the orientation of the device.
        </para>
        <para>
            The width selection
            can, for example, be used
            to provide different
            layouts
            based on the width of the device.
            This
            selection is based on
            <parameter>-sw[Number]dp</parameter>
            (Smallest) or
            <parameter>-w[Number]dp</parameter>
            qualifier, where
            [Number] stands for the number of device independent
            pixels. For example, a 7inch tablet typically has at least 600dp and
            you could provide layouts for it via the
            <parameter>res/layout-sw600dp/</parameter>
            selector.
