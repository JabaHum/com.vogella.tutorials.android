		<title>Fixed or relative dimensions</title>
		<para>
			Android allows you to define the size of user
			interface
			components in
			fixed or
			relative dimensions in the layout files. If you
			use fixed
			sized dimensions, e.g.,
			pixels,
			your user interface may look
			fine on a
			certain device, but the
			button
			might
			be
			too small on other
			devices with a
			higher pixel density.
		</para>

		<para>
			It
			is recommended to always use relative dimensions in
			your
			Android application.

		<para>
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			refers to one pixel on an
			Android device with
			160dpi (dots per inch).
			This is the density
			of the first available
			Android device
			(G1).
			This size
			is
			also known as
			mdpi (medium dots per inch).
		</para>
		<para>
			If you specify the size in
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			, Android automatically
			scale your user interface component
			, depending
			on the device.
		</para>
		<para>
			On a
			mdpi (a.k.a. medium density) device
			one
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			is the same as
			one
			pixel. A
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			on ldpi (low density) device is smaller
			(approx. 120dip),
			on a hdpi
			(high density) device
			is larger
			(approx. 240dpi). Therefore a
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			occupies
			approximately
			the same physical space on every device.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can use
			<parameter>dp</parameter>
			in your resources, e.g., layout files.

		<title>Using sp to scale with the user text preferences</title>
		<para>
			If the unit should scale with text preference settings of the
			user,
			choose the
			<parameter>sp</parameter>
			unit of measurement. This unit is similar to dp, but it is also
			scaled
			by the user preference.
		</para>
		<para>
			If the users select to increase the font size in this settings, views

			<parameter>sp</parameter>
			are scaled accordingly.
