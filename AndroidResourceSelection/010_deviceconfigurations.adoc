== Android device configurations

=== Handling different Android devices

Android device comes in a variety of different configurations in the sense of size, screen pixel density, language settings, etc.

To provide the correct resources and setting for these different configurations, Android support the automatic selection of resources and the definition of the size of user interface components in a relative size format (device independent pixel).

=== Resource qualifiers

Android allows you to use resource qualifiers to specify that certain resources should only be used for a specific device configuration (e.g., orientation, resolution, languages). 
To provide different resource files, e.g., layouts for configurations described by a `qualifier` selector, you should create a new sub-folder in the _res_ folder using this qualifier, for example, _layout-qualifier_ for layouts.

NOTE: Android selects the correct file automatically based on the current configuration.
