			Support libraries are changing very fast therefore it is hard to create a "stable" description how to use them.
		      Also unfortunately the templates of Android studio for generating Android projects are changing all the time
			and have recently been changed to include the design support library, even if that is not necessary, e.g., in case
			you are targeting a recent device.
			This
			make
			testing a new feature or standard API harder
			and makes it
			harder to follow a tutorial as the
			generated
			project changes all the time.

		<title>Converting a project to a standard Android project
		The build dependency in the Gradle build file does not hurt but you need to remove the references to the
			compatibility library from your code and your resources.
		
		
			For this,
			change the code of the generated
			activity
			to extend
			`Activity`
			instead of any other activity like
			`AppCompatActivity`
			. Also, reduces the example code to the minimum. The following is an example for an activity called
			`MainActivity`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/compat/MainActivity.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		Also ensures that only standard elements are using the generated layout file. The following is an example
			listing for a simple standard layout file.
		

		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/firstlayoutconversion10.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Changing the styles file</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/compat/activity_main.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Also ensure that the theme is a default theme, instead of the compatibility theme. For this check the
			<filename>app/res/values/styles.xml</filename>
			folder to use the standard material theme.
		

		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/firststylechangesxml.png"/>
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Changing the styles file</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/compat/styles.xml" />
			</programlisting>
		
		Start the application after these changes, it should still start and look similar.
