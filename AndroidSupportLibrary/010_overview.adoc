== Support library to support older devices
The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of
Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. 
Each support library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level.

In general you find two types of support libraries. The first type provides framework functionality for older API
releases, the second type provides new functionality for all devices. This functionality is either net yet part of the
platform or will never be part of the platform, so that Google can continue to improve it faster than Android platform
API.
