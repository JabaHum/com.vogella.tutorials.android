== Remove usage of the support library from a new project

=== Why would you remove the support library?
		
Support libraries are changing very fast therefore it is hard to create a "stable" description how to use them.
Also unfortunately the templates of Android studio for generating Android projects are changing all the time
and have recently been changed to include the design support library, even if that is not necessary, e.g., in case
you are targeting a recent device.
This
make
testing a new feature or standard API harder
and makes it
harder to follow a tutorial as the
generated
project changes all the time.
		
	
=== Converting a project to a standard Android project

The build dependency in the Gradle build file does not hurt but you need to remove the references to the
compatibility library from your code and your resources.
		
		
For this,
change the code of the generated
activity
to extend
`Activity`
instead of any other activity like
`AppCompatActivity`
. Also, reduces the example code to the minimum. The following is an example for an activity called
`MainActivity`
.

[source,java]
----
include::res/compat/MainActivity.java[]
----		

Also ensures that only standard elements are using the generated layout file. The following is an example
listing for a simple standard layout file.

----
include::res/compat/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Also ensure that the theme is a default theme, instead of the compatibility theme. For this check the
_app/res/values/styles.xml_
folder to use the standard material theme.
